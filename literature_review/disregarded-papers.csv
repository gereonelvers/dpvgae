In this paper, we discuss a project to develop a system that supports mobile wireless devices for visiting nurses, in place of an existing paper-based system. The wireless system allows nurses to securely access, update and query a central database containing patient information. One of the applications developed for this project is supplies management, where nurses can, during regular client visits, order replenishment stock to be delivered to the site by a supplier. We describe the detailed development of an As-Is business process map, leading to a significantly improved To-Be process to realize the expected benefits. A model of the ordering/logistics process was also developed, to evaluate supply service policy options that could further optimize supplies management.;"[Archer, Norm] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Bajaj, Harjeet] Canadian Inst Hlth Informat, Toronto, ON M4P 2Y3, Canada; [Zhang, Huiying] Tianjin Univ, Sch Management, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China";Archer, N (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.;"archer@mcmaster.ca; harj.bajaj@gmail.com; hyzhang@tju.edu.cn";;;20;5;5;0;6;0315-5986;1916-0615;;MAY;2008;46;2;137;145;;10.3138/infor.46.2.137;http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/infor.46.2.137;9;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000262383500005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental standards in the coating industry are becoming strained, but at the same time the market requires products that provide better protection. In new product development, the key factor is efficiency as it is important to develop a new product in the shortest possible time with the lowest costs. The development process is carried out with a laboratory testing a large number of formulations relatively early while only a few of them meet technical requirements. They are also often not economically viable or acceptable from an environmental point of view. Using the innovative information solution, process workflow was improved. By obtaining data from cloud databases, the environmental relevance as well as the price acceptability of each formulation can be checked, even before the laboratory tests were carried out. Consequently, only those formulations that were environmentally and cost suitable were tested. In this way, the number of laboratory tests were significantly minimized, and consequently amounts of waste were reduced to a minimum.;"[Urh, Benjamin; Senegacnik, Marjan; Kern, Tomaz; Krhac, Eva] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Lab Enterprise Engn, Maribor, Slovenia";Urh, B (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Lab Enterprise Engn, Maribor, Slovenia.;benjamin.urh@um.si;;Urh, Benjamin/0000-0002-2579-2759;51;2;2;2;2;1230-1485;2083-5906;;;2020;29;5;3841;3851;;10.15244/pjoes/117657;http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/117657;11;Environmental Sciences;WOS:000539752000035;View Full Record in Web of Science

Incidents and quality problems are a prime cause why health care leaders are calling to redesign health care delivery One of the concepts used is lean thinking. Yet, lean often leads to resistance. Also, there is a lack of high quality evidence supporting lean premises. In this paper, we present an overview of lean thinking and its application to health care. Development, theory and application of lean thinking to health care. Lean thinking evolved from a tool designed to improve operational shop-floor performance at an automotive manufacturer to a management approach with both operational and sociotechnical aspects. Sociotechnical dynamics have until recently not received much attention. At the same time a balanced approach might lead to a situation where operational and sociotechnial improvements are mutually reinforcing. Application to health care has been limited and focussed mainly on operational aspects using original lean tools. A more integrative approach would be to pay more attention to sociotechnical dynamics of lean implementation efforts. Also, the need to use the original lean tools may be limited, because health care may have different instruments and tools already in use that are in line with lean thinking principles. Discussion. We believe lean thinking has the potential to improve health care delivery. At the same time, there are methodological and practical considerations that need to be taken into account. Otherwise, lean implementation will be superficial and fail, adding to existing resistance and making it more difficult to improve health care in the long term.;"[Joosten, Tom; Bongers, Inge; Janssen, Richard] Tilburg Univ, Sci Ctr Care & Welf, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Joosten, Tom; Bongers, Inge] Ctr Res & Dev, Inst Mental Hlth Care Eindhoven, GGzE, Eindhoven, Netherlands";Joosten, T (corresponding author), Tilburg Univ, Sci Ctr Care & Welf, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.;t.c.m.joosten@uvt.nl;Joosten, Tom/A-9819-2011;Janssen, Richard/0000-0003-1032-7501;39;202;205;6;86;1353-4505;;;OCT;2009;21;5;341;347;;10.1093/intqhc/mzp036;http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzp036;7;"Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services";WOS:000270679700006;View Full Record in Web of Science

As employees build and scrutinize process maps of their organization, they develop a new comprehension of the structure and operation of their organization. What they had perceived as purposively designed, relatively stable, and largely external is revealed to be continuously produced through social interaction. I trace how this altered comprehension of the organization's functioning and logic changes employees' orientation to and place within the organization. Their central roles are revealed as less efficacious than imagined and, in fact, as reproducing the organization's inefficiencies. Alienated from their central operational roles, they voluntarily move to peripheral change roles from which they feel empowered to pursue organization-wide change. The paper offers two contributions. First, it identifies a new means through which central actors may become disembedded, that is, detailed comprehensive knowledge of the logic and operations of the surrounding social system. Second, the paper problematizes established insights about the relationship between social position and challenges to the status quo. Rather than a peripheral social location creating a desire to challenge the status quo, a desire to challenge the status quo may encourage central actors to choose a peripheral social location.;[Huising, Ruthanne] Emlyon Business Sch, F-69134 Ecully, France;Huising, R (corresponding author), Emlyon Business Sch, F-69134 Ecully, France.;huising@em-lyon.com;;;67;4;4;1;32;1047-7039;;;SEP-OCT;2019;30;5;1054;1075;;10.1287/orsc.2018.1277;http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1277;22;Management;WOS:000488201400009;View Full Record in Web of Science

The method focusses on business process implications of IoT. The paper also discusses a real application of the proposed method to the machinery industry. Design/methodology/approach - Considering the IoT technologies available, failure mode and effects analysis is applied to identify what should be monitored in the product to minimize potential product failures. In parallel, in order to assist the company in deciding which PSS strategy to be followed, a Configurator of PSS proposals is applied. The results are derived to define the IoT architecture and the business process design supported by the selected IoT technologies. Findings - The main findings include the proposed IoT-enabled PSS adoption method, illustrated by the description of the application and its assessment. In addition, the identification of key process areas that are impacted by IoT is offered, namely: remote machine setup; corrective and predictive maintenance; material supply; product pricing; and information reporting. Research limitations/implications - The application of the method proposed is limited to one company. Future work includes extending the application of the method to other units of analysis. Practical implications - The method proposed can be considered by companies willing to increase product-service revenues based on IoT technologies.

We argue that the impact of ICT on a coordination system typically needs to be studied on a case-by-case basis. A case study utilizing multi-agent simulation to support decision-making is described. We built the simulation system based on a theoretical model and a real world case. Through a proper verification process, we demonstrate that a multi-agent simulation experiment is a valid decision support tool for IT investment decisions. From the particular context of our case, we observe that the adoption of ICT is not a determinant of productivity. To save time and to cut cost, decision makers should focus more on technology utilization and business process redesign.

This debt defaulting may lead to proliferating liquidity constraints for subsequent supply chain partners. Consequently, this paper provides a proper toolkit for assessing and mitigating the propagation of liquidity constraints in supply chains. The paper uses the accounting-based Resource-Event-Agent ontology to create workflow patterns for modelling exchanges between supply chain partners and for the value chains that represent an organisation's internal processes. Both the exchange and internal processes continuously convert money into resources and vice versa. These models for money to resource and resource to money conversions are then used for constructing supply chain models for liquidity modelling and analysis.;"[Laurier, Wim; Poels, Geert] Univ Ghent, Dept Management Informat & Operat Management, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium";;"wim.laurier@ugent.be; geert.poels@ugent.be";"Laurier, Wim/K-9592-2019; Poels, Geert/D-1130-2013; Laurier, Wim/C-9457-2013";"Laurier, Wim/0000-0002-9448-248X; Poels, Geert/0000-0001-9247-6150; Laurier, Wim/0000-0002-9448-248X";21;2;2;0;2;1865-1348;;978-3-642-01914-2;;2009;34;;40;54;;;;15;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000267689000004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Business engineering helps to achieve mentioned objectives. Information technology is the key factor of development and implementation of business (process) change, which also in turn influences the improvement of the company's information system that should provide data needed in business (processes). Companies seek means for efficient analysis of vast amount of gathered data from their IT systems to improve business operations and achieve a competitive advantage. They are using Business Intelligence (BI) technology to analyze every aspect of their data to understand business operation and recognize, monitor, analyze and improve business processes, and finally gain a competitive advantage in the market. The paper points out the significance of Business Intelligence for certain activities of business engineering such as: define business strategy, business process redesign, business process management, decision making (process) redesign and change of the business information system.;"[Curko, Katarina; Varga, Mladen] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ, Dept Business Comp, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 41000, Croatia";Curko, K (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ, Dept Business Comp, Trg JF Kennedy 6, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.;"kcurko@efzg.hr; mvarga@efzg.hr";Curko, Katarina/H-7805-2018;Curko, Katarina/0000-0002-2489-6791;19;1;1;1;8;1792-4308;;978-960-6766-47-3;;2008;;;396;+;;;;3;Mathematics, Applied;WOS:000255184600061;View Full Record in Web of Science

Because customized processes might not lead to optimal performance, health-care managers are considering business process redesign, implementation of standardized (brief) therapies, stepped care, and policy changes to solve supply chain management issues. We develop a system dynamics model to support the management of intake and treatment processes in mental health care. We first model the existing situation in the care unit (Base Scenario of customized care) and simulate the impact of policy changes (assigning scarce personnel resources to different care activities) and redesign of intake and treatment processes (implementing brief therapies and stepped care). We show that shifting personnel resources between intake and treatment activities does not substantially improve performance. We found better results of process redesign and stepped care (+42% client intake rate and +18% revenues per day).

The literature review was based on a multi-disciplinary research approach by incorporating organizational factors, cultural dimensions, and user satisfaction in implementation of ERP' for developing countries. The eight ERP software's customers in Thailand were chosen for eleven semi-structured interviews performed during the period of April 2007 to April 2008. The findings confirm that management commitment, IT maturity, and computer culture are important factors influencing user satisfaction of the ERP projects. A company with richer Business Process Redesign (BPR) experience is more likely to succeed with ERP. Interestingly, the collectivism of ERP teamwork and composition is also critical issue for ERP implementation's satisfactions. Dealing with masculinity of users may lead to more satisfactions toward ERP implementation. Solving high uncertainty avoidance tends to boost users confidence and familiarity of users. The findings and recommendations can be useful for developing countries with similar conditions.;"[Kanthawongs, Penjira] Bangkok Univ, Sch Business Adm, Bangkok 10110, Thailand; [Kanthawongs, Penjuree] Kasem Bundit Univ, Bachelor Business Adm, English Program, Bangkok 10250, Thailand";Kanthawongs, P (corresponding author), Bangkok Univ, Sch Business Adm, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.;;;;39;0;0;1;1;;;978-1-934272-90-9;;2010;;;134;139;;;;6;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";WOS:000391415500025;View Full Record in Web of Science

A theoretical framework of Lewin's three-phase model of change and Pettigrew's ideas of context are used to tease out the dynamics of the change process. The framework is used as a basis for a longitudinal case study to understand the process of management accounting change. It reveals that the extranet, specifically through its reporting facilities, is a very important tool that facilitated changes in information availability and business process redesign. It provides the accountants with accurate and timely information about sales, cash collection and inventory levels which assisted the company to change its sales from consignment basis to a just-in-time basis. Our findings confirm that management accounting practices have changed in the case under study and show how management accountants have become more involved in the day-to-day running of the business. One of our contributions is modifying Lewin's model to consider the rich context in which the change process takes place.;[Youssef, Mayada A.] UAE Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Dept Accounting, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates;;mayada_youssef@uaeu.ac.ae;;;65;0;0;0;1;;;978-606-505-347-2;;2010;;;555;582;;;;28;"Business, Finance; Economics";WOS:000284258100034;View Full Record in Web of Science

We review theories that have previously been used to explain behavior toward electronic communication media, highlighting a theoretical gap, which is partially filled with a new Darwinian perspective called media compensation theory. Eight theoretical principles are discussed - media naturalness, innate schema similarity, learned schema variety, evolutionary task relevance, compensatory adaptation, media humanness, cue removal, and speech imperative. Those principles are then used as a basis for a discussion of the impact that different media have on virtual collaboration, work and teams. Empirical evidence in connection with the theoretical framework is described. In particular, empirical studies of idea generation, problem solving, and business process redesign tasks are reviewed. The evidence reviewed provides empirical support for the theoretical framework proposed, and a future research agenda on virtual teams from a media naturalness perspective is proposed, especially in terms of temporal processes, adaptation, trust and cheater detection.;"[Hantula, Donald A.] Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Kock, Ned] Texas A&M Int Univ, Div Int Business & Technol Studies, Laredo, TX 78041 USA; [D'Arcy, John P.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Management, Mendoza Coll Business 351, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [DeRosa, Darleen M.] OnPoint Consulting, Branford, CT 06405 USA";Hantula, DA (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Dept Psychol, Weiss Hall 265-67, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;"hantula@temple.edu; nedkock@tamiu.edu; jdarcy1@nd.edu; dderosa@onpointconsultingllc.com";;;110;24;24;1;11;;;978-3-540-92783-9;;2011;;;339;363;;10.1007/978-3-540-92784-6_13;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92784-6_13;25;"Psychology, Applied; Management";WOS:000293864900015;View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper constitutes a detailed summary of recent literature on the concepts, product categories, causes, solutions, and research challenges surrounding food loss and waste management. The contribution of this article is a new classification of the causes, solutions and research challenges, based on diverse existing classifications. Solutions for reducing food loss and waste include awareness raising, business process redesign, integrated supply chain models, redistribution, recovery, and disposal. Several research direction propositions came out of this literature review: developing standardised and up-to-date data collection and concept definitions; analysing the 'awareness of the need' concept in redistribution; studying consumer behaviour; examining the performance of local versus global logistics networks in terms of food loss and waste; and identifying the role of packaging in food loss and waste and greenhouse gas emission reduction.

The company streamlined its operations through an ambitious business process redesign initiative and introduced an ERP system. The study examines the emergence of the ERP system and the enactment of simultaneous changes to the system and to the company context, along with the intentions and actions of the individuals involved. The study seeks to understand the ERP implementation process, in particular, the link between the ERP implementation process and the underlying and often subtle influences within the context. By drawing on the case study the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of triggers and consequences of the cycles of control and drift of ERP implementation. We argue that by taking account of managers' intentions, the affordance of technology and the power and cultural context, we can provide richer insights into the ERP implementation process and the dynamics of the underlying, subtle influences within the context.

Although the effects of complementary investments and their spillovers are often mentioned in the literature, there is a lack of in-depth research. This study aims to fill this gap, taking into account knowledge diffusion and complementarities between different intangible assets, and evaluating their effects on productivity. We propose new measures of knowledge, which consider these complementarities, by using principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate intangibles, and the Niche overlap index to ease interpretation. The analysis is conducted on an unbalanced country-industry panel dataset of 13 European countries, constructed from a combination of sources such as INTAN-Invest, WIOD, World Bank and EU-KLEMS. We develop total factor productivity proxies, and estimate the effects of knowledge diffusion on productivity by means of GMM panel regressions. Results confirm the importance of considering complementarities for detecting knowledge spillover effects, especially in the case of domestic spillovers, while foreign spillovers are shown to be less effective, supporting the view of knowledge spillovers as a prevalently localised phenomenon.;"[Nonnis, Alberto; Bounfour, Ahmed] Univ Paris Saclay, Fac Jean Monnet, European Chair Intangibles & RITM, Sceaux, France; [Kim, Keungoui] Handong Global Univ, Sch Appl Artificial Intelligence, Pohang, South Korea";Bounfour, A (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, Fac Jean Monnet, European Chair Intangibles & RITM, Sceaux, France.;ahmed.bounfour@universite-paris-saclay.fr;;;86;0;0;9;9;0048-7333;1873-7625;;JAN;2023;52;1;;;104611;10.1016/j.respol.2022.104611;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2022.104611;13;Management;WOS:000855658500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the promised results are not yet achieved; the healthcare process requires analysis and radical redesign to achieve improvements in care quality and productivity. Healthcare process reengineering is thus necessary and involves modeling its workflow. Even though the healthcare process is very large and not very well modeled yet, its sub-processes can be modeled individually, providing fundamental pieces of the whole model. In this paper, we are interested in modeling the radiology interpretation process that results in generating a diagnostic radiology report. This radiology report is an important clinical element of the patient healthcare record and assists in healthcare decisions. We present the radiology interpretation process by identifying its boundaries and by positioning it on the large healthcare process map. Moreover, we discuss an information data model and identify roles, tasks and several information flows.

As a background to understanding the process of change that has taken place in accounting, we use the industrial innovation model, recognizing that it also has evolved [6]. Material obtained from an ongoing research programme that is aimed at examining the development and deployment of new accounting techniques and practices is presented and discussed. This material suggests that several comparable features of contemporary industrial product innovation are also present in accounting innovation activity. These features include, inter alia, a multidiscipline team involvement and improved dialogue between lead 'users' and 'suppliers'. The improved dialogue cart result in useful feedback on new innovation trajectories. The importance of top management support for innovations in accounting cannot be underestimated if the innovations are to be successfully developed, implemented and become 'good currency'. There is evidence that accounting innovations are taking place in a rich yet complex environment of multi-inputs, increased mutual understanding of all the key players and with extended use of parallel rather sequential processes of development. A particular focus of the paper is the way that ideas associated with activity based costing have been widened and deepened to facilitate business process redesign.;;SWEETING, RC (corresponding author), UNIV MANCHESTER,INST SCI & TECHNOL,MANCHESTER SCH MANAGEMENT,POB 88,MANCHESTER M60 1QD,LANCS,ENGLAND.;;;;0;3;3;0;4;0166-4972;;;JUN;1995;15;5;289;302;;10.1016/0166-4972(95)96601-O;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-4972(95)96601-O;14;"Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:A1995RD25600002;View Full Record in Web of Science

The results reported are based on a moderate response rate (though perhaps reasonable for the target group) but formal testing showed an absence of non-response bias. The most critical issues were revealed to be a mix of technology management issues (managing and measuring the effectiveness of the information technology (IT) infrastructure, and disaster recovery), strategic management issues (business process redesign, competitive advantage, and information architecture), people and support management issues (organizational learning, and executive and decision support) and systems development and data management issues (effective use of the data resource and effectiveness of software development). This reflects their interest in a wide range of issues, but all with an organization-wide focus. The non-critical issues were mostly related to the individual technologies and the place and role of IS in the organization. While the CEOs showed some agreement with their chief information officers (CIOs) on issues such as the IT infrastructure, competitive advantage and organizational learning, some distinct differences exist, particularly in relation to the quality and effectiveness of systems and processes and also how CEOs and CIOs perceive the IT knowledge of the CEOs.;Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Informat Syst, Perth, WA 6845, Australia;Pervan, G (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Technol, Sch Informat Syst, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.;;;;25;22;22;2;12;0268-3962;;;JUN;1998;13;2;95;109;;10.1080/026839698344882;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026839698344882;15;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:000074108300003;View Full Record in Web of Science

They found out that they should focus on other aspects such as environmental and social and economic sustainability. Lately, Sustainable Human Resource Management (SHRM) is introduced as an instrument to indicate that HRM can affect the sustainable development and resource preservation of organizations. Despite that, SHRM and its related subjects are still in an emerging phase. The present study aims to propose a comprehensive approach to examine the main important factors of SHRM. To do so, a survey approach with the literature review inter-viewsview with experts is carried out to classify, rank, and evaluate the key SHRM factors in the manufacturing companies in Ecuador. In order to assess and prioritize the factors and the alternatives, this paper introduces a new approach using an integrated Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA)-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method on the Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) setting called the PF-SWARA-TOPSIS method. To do this, we extend the SWARA method to identify and rank the SHRM factors by using PFSs. Afterward, to assess and prioritize the alternatives, this study utilizes the TOPSIS approach under PFSs. Next, to show the efficacy and applicability of the developed framework, a real case study of the SHRM problem is discussed on PFSs. Furthermore, this study performs a sensitivity investigation over diverse sets of criteria weights to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methodology. The investigation results demonstrate that the green work-life balance was ranked as the first factor by following corporate social responsibility, green employee relations, and business process redesign factors.

Rationalization of transport service, reduced travelling time and reliable delivery times represent the main prerequisites for lowering the costs and increasing the efficiency of entire transport chain. These performance indicators actually represent the main factors affecting the shipper's mode choice. Improvement of these factors could be achieved by improved coordination between rail and non-rail-related stakeholders involved in freight transport service planning and realization. Since this solution requires a multi-stakeholder collaboration, it is needed to evaluate the interests of each of them in order to derive a preferred set of indicators, which will facilitate a collectively accepted solution and value alignment of all involved actors. In this paper, the preferred set of indicators was selected by using the DEcision MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) model technique integrated with the Analytic Network Process (ANP). DEMATEL is applied to analyse the causal relationships among the relevant dimensions and among the criteria within each dimension. The causal relationships are then used in ANP for determining the weights of the criteria. An empirical case study based on implementation of information sharing platform in rail intermodal transport chain is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Based on this study the attributes that belong to reliability (departing / arriving on-time, cancelled services), lead time (idle time) and investment cost (organizational culture, business process redesign) dimensions represent five the most critical factors for obtaining a collectively accepted solution. This effective evaluation model enables policy makers and stakeholders in transportation / logistics to understand and conduct appropriate actions towards fulfilling the objectives for greener transportation.;"[Milenkovic, Milos; Lutovac, Dejan; Bojovic, Nebojsa; Knezevic, Nikola] Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Belgrade, Serbia; [Milenkovic, Milos; Val, Susana] Zaragoza Logist Ctr, Zaragoza, Spain";"Milenkovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn, Belgrade, Serbia.;Milenkovic, M (corresponding author), Zaragoza Logist Ctr, Zaragoza, Spain.";m.milenkovic@sf.bg.ac.rs;;;59;0;0;8;11;1648-4142;1648-3480;;;2021;36;5;406;432;;10.3846/transport.2021.14519;http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/transport.2021.14519;27;Transportation Science & Technology;WOS:000735158900002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies in the 1980s found no connection between IT investment and productivity in the U.S. economy, a situation referred to as the productivity paradox. Since then, a decade of studies at the firm and country level has consistently shown that the impact of IT investment on labor productivity and economic growth is significant and positive. This article critically reviews the published research, more than 50 articles, on computers and productivity. It develops a general framework for classifying the research, which facilitates identifying what we know, how well we know it, and what we do not know. The framework enables us to systematically organize, synthesize, and evaluate the empirical evidence and to identify both limitations in existing research and data and substantive areas for future research. The review concludes that the productivity paradox as first formulated has been effectively refuted. At both the firm and the country level, greater investment in IT is associated with greater productivity growth. At the firm level, the review further concludes that the wide range of performance of IT investments among different organizations can be explained by complementary investments in organizational capital such as decentralized decision-making systems, job training, and business process redesign. IT is not simply a tool for automating existing processes, but is more importantly an enabler of organizational changes that can lead to additional productivity gains. In mid-2000, IT capital investment began to fall sharply due to slowing economic growth, the collapse of many Internet-related firms, and reductions in IT spending by other firms facing fewer competitive pressures from Internet firms. This reduction in IT investment has had devastating effects on the IT-producing sector, and may lead to slower economic and productivity growth in the U.S. economy. While the turmoil in the technology sector has been unsettling to investors and executives alike, this review shows that it should not overshadow the fundamental changes that have occurred as a result of firms' investments in IT. Notwithstanding the demise of many Internet-related companies, the returns to IT investment are real, and innovative companies continue to lead the way.;Univ Calif Irvine, Grad Sch Management, Ctr Res Informat Technol & Org, Irvine, CA 92697 USA;Dedrick, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Grad Sch Management, Ctr Res Informat Technol & Org, 3200 Berkeley Pl, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;"jdedrick@uci.edu; vgurbaxa@uci.edu; kkraemer@uci.edu";;;85;412;425;2;119;0360-0300;1557-7341;;MAR;2003;35;1;1;28;;10.1145/641865.641866;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/641865.641866;28;Computer Science, Theory & Methods;WOS:000181529500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Managing CTP claims involves multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting interests. It is therefore pertinent to investigate whether 'best practice' for claims processing can be identified and measured so all claimants receive fair and equitable treatment. The project set out to test the applicability of a mixed-method approach to identify 'best-practice' using qualitative, process mining, and data mining techniques in an insurance claims processing domain. Relevance: Existing approaches typically identify 'best practice' from literature or surveys of practitioners. The study provides insights into an alternative, mixed-method approach to deriving best practice from historical data and domain knowledge. Methodology: The study is a reflective analysis of insights gained from a practical application of a mixed-method approach to determine 'best practice'. Results: The mixed-method approach has a number of benefits over traditional approaches in uncovering best practice process behavior from historical data in the real-world context (i.e., can identify process behavior differences between high and low performing cases). The study also highlights a number of challenges with regards to the quality and detail of data that needs to be available to perform the analysis. Managerial Implications: The 'lessons learned' from this study will directly benefit others seeking to implement a data-driven approach to understand a 'best-practice' process in their own organization.;"[Poppe, Erik; Pika, Anastasiia; Wynn, Moe Thandar; Eden, Rebekah; Andrews, Robert; ter Hofstede, Arthur H.

While Western enterprises have successes and failures in their implementation experiences, implementing ER-P in Chinese organizations is not as straightforward as managing it in well-developed Western organizations. In particular, a number of problems contribute to the low success rate of ERP implementation in China. Given the complexity and complication of those problems, adopters cannot just simply pick up critical success factors from the West and implement them accordingly. Adjustments and adaptations are needed. The purpose of this paper, then, is to suggest a bundling strategy that combines BPR with ERP as the pre-step to a full ERP implementation.;Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Dept Informat Syst, Singapore 117543, Singapore;Chen, XX (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Dept Informat Syst, 3 Sci Dr 2, Singapore 117543, Singapore.;"chenxinx@comp.nus.edu.sg; pansl@comp.nus.edu.sg";Pan, Shan L/M-6996-2017;;32;0;0;0;2;;;7-81013-975-4;;2002;;;474;479;;;;6;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems";WOS:000177214600079;View Full Record in Web of Science

A business process is deemed successful if a large enough proportion of instances dwell in a workflow (wait and be executed) for less than given period. By analyzing instances' dwelling time distribution in a workflow, the proportion of instances which dwell in the workflow for less than any given period will be achieved. The performance analysis of workflow model plays an important role in the research of workflow techniques and efficient implementation of workflow management. It includes the analysis of instances' dwelling time distribution in a workflow process. Multidimensional workflow net (MWF-net) includes multiple timing workflow nets (TWF-nets) and the organization and resource information. The processes of transaction instances form a queuing model in which the transaction instances act as customers and the resources act as servers. The key contribution of this paper is twofold. First, this paper presents a theoretical method to calculate the instances' dwelling time probability density in a workflow where the activities are structured and predictable. Second, by this method the analysis of instances' dwelling time distribution and satisfactory degree based on dwelling time can be achieved. The service time of an instance is specified by the firing delay of the corresponding transition (executing time of the corresponding activity). It is assumed that the service request (processing of a transaction instance) arrives with exponentially distributed inter-arrival times and the firing delay of a transition (executing time of the corresponding activity) follows exponential distribution. Then, the instances' dwelling time probability density analysis in each activity and each control structure of a workflow model is performed. According to the above results a method is proposed for computing the instances' dwelling time probability density in a workflow model. Finally an example is used to show that the proposed method can be effectively utilized in practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Responding to what appears to be a lack of payoff in IT investments, researchers as well as practitioners recently have suggested that traditional valuation analyses are incomplete and have called for additional work to identify hidden or seldom-considered costs and benefits. The present paper attempts to improve understanding of a chief source of these hidden costs and benefits: those changes in the social subsystem brought about by a new IT. Fifty IT decision-makers in a broad variety of industries were interviewed to gain insight into what, when, and how often social subsystem considerations are included in IT investment-decision processes. Data from the interviews show that in practice some of those issues are often minimized, excluded, or put off until the IT is implemented-thus affecting optimality of investment choices and IT payoff. The paper extends existing theory by describing systematic patterns of inclusion and exclusion of these costs and benefits. In addition, a decision aid is provided to help IT executives begin thinking about which social subsystem costs and benefits they should incorporate in various decisions. Suggestions are also made on how data regarding social subsystem costs and benefits might be gathered. By incorporating social subsystem costs and benefits in the IT investment process, decision-makers gain a greater appreciation for hidden costs and benefits, and thus clarify anticipated IT payoff.;"Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA; Univ Texas, Arlington, TX 76019 USA";Ryan, SD (corresponding author), Univ N Texas, Denton, TX 76203 USA.;;Harrison, David A/G-3342-2012;Harrison, David A/0000-0001-5247-3633;74;59;60;2;17;0742-1222;;;SPR;2000;16;4;11;40;;10.1080/07421222.2000.11518264;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07421222.2000.11518264;30;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:000088154600002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, many organisations struggle to achieve the benefits they expected from a BPMS. This interpretive case study in a large South African financial services organisation explains factors found to negatively impact successful BPMS adoption. The paper describes how an IT team struggled to increase process agility with a BPMS in a large legacy application landscape. The dominant factors causing the struggle were the difficulty of integrating with other applications and a lack of governance around BPM. Interesting findings on the difficulties in resourcing BPM IT teams are presented. The impact of BPM strategy, culture and governance on BPM methods, resourcing, data and technology is explained. The BPM literature lacks empirical qualitative case studies and theoretical models. This paper aimed to contribute to both needs. The theoretical contribution of this paper is two models. The first inductively derived explanatory contextual model should be useful for practitioners wanting to adopt a BPMS. Using this study's findings and models from the literature, a second, more generic explanatory model of information system performance is derived for a BPMS.;"[Seymour, Lisa F.; Koopman, Ashley] Univ Cape Town, Dept Informat Syst, CITANDA, Private Bag, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa";Seymour, LF (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Informat Syst, CITANDA, Private Bag, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.;Lisa.seymour@uct.ac.za;;Seymour, Lisa/0000-0001-6704-0021;86;1;1;2;5;1619-1366;1619-1374;;JUN;2022;21;3;869;890;;10.1007/s10270-021-00922-w;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10270-021-00922-w;22;Computer Science, Software Engineering;WOS:000693504300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Using argument mapping to examine the contours of management fashion;INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION;English;Article;;"SERVICE-ORIENTED-ARCHITECTURE; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS RESEARCH; BUSINESS PROCESS REDESIGN; ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; IMPLEMENTATION; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; ORGANIZATIONS; PERSPECTIVE";This paper examines management fashion discourse based on the premise that management fashions are not neutral, but problematic. It grounds this premise on Abrahamson and Fairchild's (1999) observation that attributes the upswings of management fashion discourse to emotionally charged, enthusiastic and unreasoned discourse. Adopting this critical perspective, the paper conducts a careful analysis of faddish discourse in an attempt to understand the discursive ailments that would justify ascribing a diagnosis of unreasoned to this discourse. To achieve this goal, the paper employs the technique of argument mapping to examine and compare the structures of early discourse surrounding: (1) Business Process Reengineering (BPR) typically now considered a fad: (2) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) - an enduring, non-faddish IS discourse: and (3) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) - a more recent discourse that is evaluated based on insights derived from comparisons of BPR and ERP. Findings from the resultant argument maps show conspicuous differences between BPR and ERP argumentation, which suggests an association between early argument structure and the faddish trajectory of discourse. Similarly, insights derived from ERP and BPR argument comparisons suggest that SOA is more likely to follow the faddish course of its BPR predecessor rather than the enduring track of ERP.

We find that computerization makes a contribution to measured productivity and output growth in the short term (using 1-year differences) that is consistent with normal returns to computer investments. However, the productivity and output contributions associated with computerization are up to 5 times greater over long periods (using 5- to 7-year differences). The results suggest that the observed contribution of computerization is accompanied by relatively large and time-consuming investments in complementary inputs, such as organizational capital, that may be omitted in conventional calculations of productivity. The large long-run contribution of computers and their associated complements that we uncover may partially explain the subsequent investment surge in computers in the late 1990s.;"MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";Brynjolfsson, E (corresponding author), MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;;Brynjolfsson, Erik/H-2412-2012;;61;511;530;2;67;0034-6535;1530-9142;;NOV;2003;85;4;793;808;;10.1162/003465303772815736;http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/003465303772815736;16;"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods";WOS:000186322400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few would argue that the mere use of web-based NPD systems substantially will improve the NPD process. But we know little about how and when these systems can be used for enhancing NPD. An organization desiring to employ the web in its NPD process can use it at varying levels of functionality and sophistication, ranging from a tool for automating manual tasks and exchanging data to a means of integrating various intra- and interorganizational NPD functions and processes. At higher levels of technology sophistication or integration, an organization's NPD processes will get more integrated internally, i.e., between different stages of the NPD process and with the processes of its suppliers, technology providers, etc. Such integration of both internal and external NPD processes is considered important for successful innovation. Thus, on the surface, higher levels of web-based systems integration may seem universally desirable. However, each increasing level of integration brings with it higher costs-not only the costs of expensive technology but also costs of implementing a complicated system, redesigning intra- and interorganizational processes, disrupting the status quo, and spending management time and energy during implementation. Therefore, it may not be wise for firms to jump blindly on the web-based NPD bandwagon. High levels of web-based NPD systems integration may be created when low levels of integration may not deliver the desired results. Further, if such systems are installed without appropriate conditions within and outside the firm, it may not be possible to exploit their full potential. As such, it is important to know how much web-based NPD systems integration is suitable for different conditions. In this article, we develop a conceptual framework that focuses on how web-based NPD systems integration can influence the outcome of NPD and how the relationship between systems integration and outcomes can be affected by various contextual factors. For this purpose, we draw on research in areas such as NPD, web-based information systems, and organization theory and on many discussions we had with professionals and software vendors who deal with NPD and web-based NPD systems. The contextual factors of interest in this framework are strategic orientation of the firm, product-related factors, business environment, organizational factors, information technology factors, and partner-characteristics.

While evidence suggests that both HIT and integration confer independent benefits, when combined, they may provide complementary means to achieve high performance or overlap to offset each other's contribution. We explore this relationship in the context of hospital adherence to evidence-based practices (EBPs). Using the American Hospital Association's Annual and IT Supplement surveys, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's Hospital Compare, we estimate the independent relationships and interactions between HIT and hospital-physician integration with respect to EBP adherence. HIT adoption and tight (but not loose) integration are independently associated with greater adherence to EBPs. The interaction between HIT adoption and tight integration is negative, consistent with an offsetting association between HIT adoption and integration in their relationship to EBP adherence.

This is achieved through a comprehensive review of the business process management (BPM) and operations management (OM) literatures. Our comparison of the existing bodies of knowledge in these disciplines reveals major inconsistencies in how the topic of process design in service environments is addressed. Drawing on the more mature, contingency-oriented OM literature, we challenge the BPM discipline which prescribes that process design principles derived from best practices are universally applicable irrespective of the context in which the service organisation operates. The results strongly suggest that in the business process design area one size does not fit all service organisations and that some design principles fit better under certain contextual conditions. We then use these findings to develop a contingency conceptual framework and associated research propositions linking the firm's service strategy context to the use of particular business process design principles. This extends existing theory and provides a platform for future process design research in service organisations that is more closely aligned with the needs of practitioners.;"[Ponsignon, F.; Smart, P.

While relevant studies presume that humans and materials are distinct and largely independent, sociomateriality emphasizes agency that represents the relational, emergent, and shifting capacity realized through the association of actors (both humans and materials). The objective of this paper is to explore the value of conducting IT capability research through the theoretical lens of sociomaterialism. For this, we expand the imbrication metaphor introduced in an early study to explain the formation and advancement of a firm's IT capability from the sociomaterial perspective. Then, the key building blocks of IT capability of an organization are conceptualized based on the combination of existing studies and the expanded imbrication metaphor. Lastly, the effectiveness of formulating IT capability as a third-order construct that substantiates the entanglement concept of sociomaterialism is examined in comparison with that of traditional modeling approaches. We confirm the value of sociomaterialism in conceptualizing IT capability and subsequently in unraveling the true contribution of IT capability toward strengthening business performance. The findings also have practical implications in which IT capability is a function of IT management capability as well as IT personnel capability and IT infrastructure capability.;"[Kim, Gimun] Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taejon, South Korea; [Shin, Bongsik; Kwon, Ohbyung] San Diego State Univ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Kwon, Ohbyung] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Kwon, Ohbyung] Carnegie Mellon Univ, ISRI, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA";Kim, G (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Sch Business Adm, Taejon, South Korea.;;;"Shin, Bongsik/0000-0002-2031-1493; Kim, Gimun/0000-0002-1832-7592";96;64;69;4;94;0742-1222;1557-928X;;WIN;2012;29;3;327;362;;10.2753/MIS0742-1222290310;http://dx.doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222290310;36;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:000318678100011;View Full Record in Web of Science

One of these opportunities consists in a better response to dynamic market needs by marketing products/services packages (PS-Ps) with greater added value for the client. The aim of this work is to define a conceptual framework to support the characterization, design, and/or management of one of the key processes in client satisfaction and operational efficiency: the order promising process (OPP) in the context of collaborative selling network (CSN), which markets PS-Ps. To attain this objective, a research method based initially on the search for studies was followed to help define a conceptual framework for OPP characterization, and also the elements and structure it should have. On the basis of this initial search, a structure for a conceptual framework for the characterization of the OPP is proposed and specific studies that assist in determining and defining the contents of such a conceptual framework are analyzed. With the proposed conceptual framework, the members of a CSN can easily and systematically identify and define all the aspects that influence the OPP in a collaborative context, and may design the process in such a way that client satisfaction and SN efficiency are maximized, Furthermore, the framework structure and contents may be useful to analyze existing literature from a scientific point of view, thus enabling the identification of future lines of research.

It can be used to diagnose pathological conditions of the eye, and for developing pre-operative surgical plans. In contrast to the posterior retina, imaging the anterior tissue structures, such as the limbus and cornea, results in B-scans that exhibit increased speckle noise patterns and imaging artifacts. These artifacts, such as shadowing and specularity, pose a challenge during the analysis of the acquired volumes as they substantially obfuscate the location of tissue interfaces. To deal with the artifacts and speckle noise patterns and accurately segment the shallowest tissue interface, we propose a cascaded neural network framework, which comprises of a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and a Tissue Interface Segmentation Network (TISN). The cGAN pre-segments OCT B-scans by removing undesired specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns just above the shallowest tissue interface, and the TISN combines the original OCT image with the pre-segmentation to segment the shallowest interface. We show the applicability of the cascaded framework to corneal datasets, demonstrate that it precisely segments the shallowest corneal interface, and also show its generalization capacity to limbal datasets. We also propose a hybrid framework, wherein the cGAN pre-segmentation is passed to a traditional image analysis-based segmentation algorithm, and describe the improved segmentation performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to remove severe specular artifacts and speckle noise patterns (prior to the shallowest interface) that affects the interpretation of anterior segment OCT datasets, thereby resulting in the accurate segmentation of the shallowest tissue interface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to show the potential of incorporating a cGAN into larger deep learning frameworks for improved corneal and limbal OCT image segmentation. Our cGAN design directly improves the visualization of corneal and limbal OCT images from OCT scanners, and improves the performance of current OCT segmentation algorithms.

Most of existing algorithms are aimed at two fusion targets, which makes them have to adopt sequential way to merge multiple images. Unfortunately, this may make their results vulnerable to ambiguity or artifact. The second is the ground truth of fused results could not be obtained at all in some image fusion fields (e.g., multi-band images). That leads immediately to the failure of supervised methods to give full play to their advantages. Third, the latent projection between the result and source images is often not directly considered. Notably, the relation involves not only the fusion result with all inputs, but also with each original. In order to solve aforementioned problems, this paper establishes a unsupervised representation learning model for synchronous multi-band images fusion. First, significant pixel fusion features are extracted to ensure that the primary information can be integrated. Secondly, the potential relationship between the result and the whole originals is assumed to be the linear mapping, reducing the unpredictability of these fusion results. In addition, these transformation matrices have been given the function of feature selection, which could choose discriminant features and project them into the fusion space. Then, the locally significant features of each source are captured by designed graph Laplacian matrix.

Automatic algorithms for image analysis have thus become an invaluable tool in medicine. Examples of this are two- and three-dimensional visualizations, image segmentation, and the registration of all anatomical structure and pathology types. In this context, we introduce Studierfenster (www.studierfenster.at): a free, non-commercial open science client-server framework for (bio-)medical image analysis. Studierfenster offers a wide range of capabilities, including the visualization of medical data (CT, MRI, etc.) in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) space in common web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. Other functionalities are the calculation of medical metrics (dice score and Hausdorff distance), manual slice-by-slice outlining of structures in medical images, manual placing of (anatomical) landmarks in medical imaging data, visualization of medical data in virtual reality (VR), and a facial reconstruction and registration of medical data for augmented reality (AR). More sophisticated features include the automatic cranial implant design with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the inpainting of aortic dissections with a generative adversarial network, and a CNN for automatic aortic landmark detection in CT angiography images. A user study with medical and non-medical experts in medical image analysis was performed, to evaluate the usability and the manual functionalities of Studierfenster. When participants were asked about their overall impression of Studierfenster in an ISO standard (ISO-Norm) questionnaire, a mean of 6.3 out of 7.0 possible points were achieved. The evaluation also provided insights into the results achievable with Studierfenster in practice, by comparing these with two ground truth segmentations performed by a physician of the Medical University of Graz in Austria. In this contribution, we presented an online environment for (bio-)medical image analysis. In doing so, we established a client-server-based architecture, which is able to process medical data, especially 3D volumes. Our online environment is not limited to medical applications for humans. Rather, its underlying concept could be interesting for researchers from other fields, in applying the already existing functionalities or future additional implementations of further image processing applications. An example could be the processing of medical acquisitions like CT or MRI from animals [Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 84(4):448-456, 68], which get more and more common, as veterinary clinics and centers get more and more equipped with such imaging devices. Furthermore, applications in entirely non-medical research in which images/volumes need to be processed are also thinkable, such as those in optical measuring techniques, astronomy, or archaeology.;"[Egger, Jan; Wild, Daniel; Weber, Maximilian; Bedoya, Christopher A.

Videoconferencing portrays valuable non-verbal communication and face expression cues, but usually requires a front-facing camera. Using a frontal camera in a hands-free setting when a person is on the move is impractical. Even holding a mobile phone camera in the front of the face while sitting for a long duration is not convenient. To overcome these issues, we propose a low-cost wearable egocentric camera setup that can be integrated into smart glasses. Our goal is to mimic a classical video call, and therefore, we transform the egocentric perspective of this camera into a front facing video. To this end, we employ a conditional generative adversarial neural network that learns a transition from the highly distorted egocentric views to frontal views common in videoconferencing. Our approach learns to transfer expression details directly from the egocentric view without using a complex intermediate parametric expressions model, as it is used by related face reenactment methods. We successfully handle subtle expressions, not easily captured by parametric blendshape-based solutions, e.g., tongue movement, eye movements, eye blinking, strong expressions and depth varying movements. To get control over the rigid head movements in the target view, we condition the generator on synthetic renderings of a moving neutral face. This allows us to synthesis results at different head poses. Our technique produces temporally smooth video-realistic renderings in real-time using a video-to-video translation network in conjunction with a temporal discriminator. We demonstrate the improved capabilities of our technique by comparing against related state-of-the art approaches.;"[Elgharib, Mohamed; Mendiratta, Mohit; Seidel, Hans-Peter; Tewari, Ayush; Golyanik, Vladislav; Theobalt, Christian] Max Planck Inst Informat, SIC, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Thies, Justus; Niessner, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany";;Elgharib, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Informat, SIC, Saarbrucken, Germany.;"elgharib@mpi-inf.mpg.de; mmendira@mpi-inf.mpg.de; justus.thies@tum.de; niessner@tum.de; hpseidel@mpi-sb.mpg.de; atewari@mpi-inf.mpg.de; golyanik@mpi-inf.mpg.de; theobalt@mpi-inf.mpg.de";39;3;3;0;6;DEC;2020;39;6;;;268;10.1145/3414685.3417808;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3414685.3417808;WOS:000595589100108;View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast to existing approaches that are restricted to manipulations of facial expressions only, we are the first to transfer the full 3D head position, head rotation, face expression, eye gaze, and eye blinking from a source actor to a portrait video of a target actor. The core of our approach is a generative neural network with a novel space-time architecture. The network takes as input synthetic renderings of a parametric face model, based on which it predicts photo-realistic video frames for a given target actor. The realism in this rendering-to-video transfer is achieved by careful adversarial training, and as a result, we can create modified target videos that mimic the behavior of the synthetically-created input. In order to enable source-to-target video re-animation, we render a synthetic target video with the reconstructed head animation parameters from a source video, and feed it into the trained network - thus taking full control of the target. With the ability to freely recombine source and target parameters, we are able to demonstrate a large variety of video rewrite applications without explicitly modeling hair, body or background. For instance, we can reenact the full head using interactive user-controlled editing, and realize high-fidelity visual dubbing. To demonstrate the high quality of our output, we conduct an extensive series of experiments and evaluations, where for instance a user study shows that our video edits are hard to detect.;"[Kim, Hyeongwoo; Tewari, Ayush; Xu, Weipeng; Theobalt, Christian] Max Planck Inst Informat, Campus E1-4, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Garrido, Pablo; Perez, Patrick] Technicolor, 975 Ave Champs Blancs, F-35576 Cesson Sevigne, France; [Thies, Justus; Niessner, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Richardt, Christian] Univ Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Zollhofer, Michael] Stanford Univ, 353 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";;Kim, H (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Informat, Campus E1-4, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.;"hyeongwoo.kim@mpi-nf.mpg.de; pablo.garrido.adrian@gmail.com; atewari@mpi-inf.mpg.de; wxu@mpi-inf.mpg.de; justus.thies@tum.de; niessner@tum.de; Patrick.Perez@technicolor.com; christian@richardt.name; zollhoefer@cs.stanford.edu; theobalt@mpi-inf.mpg.de";69;133;138;2;13;AUG;2018;37;4;;;ART163;10.1145/3197517.3201283;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3197517.3201283;WOS:000448185000124;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we approach this problem from a different perspective. With respect to a downsampled low resolution image, we model a high resolution image as a combination of two components, a deterministic component and a stochastic component. The deterministic component can be recovered from the low-frequency signals in the downsampled image. The stochastic component, on the other hand, contains the signals that have little correlation with the low resolution image. We adopt two complementary methods for generating these two components. While generative adversarial networks are used for the stochastic component, deterministic component reconstruction is formulated as a regression problem solved using deep neural networks. Since the deterministic component exhibits clearer local orientations, we design novel loss functions tailored for such properties for training the deep regression network. These two methods are first applied to the entire input image to produce two distinct high-resolution images. Afterwards, these two images are fused together using another deep neural network that also performs local statistical rectification, which tries to make the local statistics of the fused image match the same local statistics of the groundtruth image. Quantitative results and a user study indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms with a clear margin.;"[Ge, Weifeng; Gong, Bingchen; Yu, Yizhou] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";;Ge, WF (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;;44;4;4;0;6;NOV;2018;37;6;;;260;10.1145/3272127.3275060;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275060;WOS:000455953100081;View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, it remains challenging to simplify extremely rough sketches. We found that a simplification network trained with a simple loss, such as pixel loss or discriminator loss, may fail to retain the semantically meaningful details when simplifying a very sketchy and complicated drawing. In this paper, we show that, with a well-designed multi-layer perceptual loss, we are able to obtain aesthetic and neat simplification results preserving semantically important global structures as well as fine details without blurriness and excessive emphasis on local structures. To do so, we design a multi-layer discriminator by fusing all VGG feature layers to differentiate sketches and clean lines. The weights used in layer fusing are automatically learned via an intelligent adjustment mechanism.

With that, our approach significantly reduces production cost compared to conventional rendering approaches based on production-quality 3D models and can also be used to realistically edit existing videos. Technically, this is achieved by training a neural network that translates simple synthetic images of a human character into realistic imagery. For training our networks, we first track the 3D motion of the person in the video using the template model and subsequently generate a synthetically rendered version of the video. These images are then used to train a conditional generative adversarial network that translates synthetic images of the 3D model into realistic imagery of the human. We evaluate our method for the reenactment of another person that is tracked to obtain the motion data, and show video results generated from artist-designed skeleton motion.

A widely employed approximate approach is to consider the thermodynamic decomposition stability due to its simplicity of computing, but it is notorious for either producing too many candidates or missing important metastable materials. These results, however, are not unexcepted since the synthesizability is a complex phenomenon, and the thermodynamic stability is just one contributor. Here, we suggest a machine-learning model to quantify the probability of synthesis based on the partially supervised learning of materials database. We adapted the positive and unlabeled machine learning (PU learning) by implementing the graph convolutional neural network as a classifier in which the model outputs crystal-likeness scores (CLscore). The model shows 87.4% true positive (CLscore > 0.5) prediction accuracy for the test set of experimentally reported cases (9356 materials) in the Materials Project. We further validated the model by predicting the synthesizability of newly reported experimental materials in the last 5 years (2015-2019) with an 86.2% true positive rate using the model trained with the database as of the end of year 2014. Our analysis shows that our model captures the structural motif for synthesizability beyond what is possible by E-hull. We find that 71 materials among the top 100 high-scoring virtual materials have indeed been previously synthesized in the literature. With the proposed data-driven metric of the crystal-likeness score, high-throughput virtual screenings and generative models can benefit significantly by effectively reducing the chemical space that needs to be explored experimentally in the future toward more rational materials design.;"[Jang, Jidon; Gu, Geun Ho; Noh, Juhwan; Kim, Juhwan; Jung, Yousung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea";;Jung, Y (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.;ysjn@kaist.ac.kr;53;23;23;7;51;Nov 04;2020;142;44;18836;18843;;10.1021/jacs.0c07384;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c07384;WOS:000585703000012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Incorporating context level information, the proposed method not only removes halftone artifacts but also synthesizes the fine details lost during halftone. The method consists of two main stages. In the first stage, intrinsic features of the scene are extracted, the low-frequency reconstruction of the image is estimated, and halftone patterns are removed. For the intrinsic features, the edges and object-categories are estimated and fed to the next stage as strong visual and contextual cues. In the second stage, fine details are synthesized on top of the low-frequency output based on an adversarial generative model. In addition, the novel problem of rescreening is addressed, where a natural input image is halftoned so as to be similar to a separately given reference halftone image. To this end, a two-stage convolutional neural network is also presented. Both networks are trained with millions of before-and-after example image pairs of various halftone styles.

To handle the complexity and variety of hair structures, most cutting-edge techniques rely on the successful retrieval of a particular hair model from a comprehensive hair database. Not only are the aforementioned data-driven methods storage intensive, but they are also prone to failure for highly unconstrained input images, complicated hairstyles, and failed face detection. Instead of using a large collection of 3D hair models directly, we propose to represent the manifold of 3D hairstyles implicitly through a compact latent space of a volumetric variational autoencoder (VAE). This deep neural network is trained with volumetric orientation field representations of 3D hair models and can synthesize new hairstyles from a compressed code. To enable end-to-end 3D hair inference, we train an additional embedding network to predict the code in the VAE latent space from any input image. Strand-level hairstyles can then be generated from the predicted volumetric representation. Our fully automatic framework does not require any ad-hoc face fitting, intermediate classification and segmentation, or hairstyle database retrieval. Our hair synthesis approach is significantly more robust and can handle a much wider variation of hairstyles than state-of-the-art data-driven hair modeling techniques with challenging inputs, including photos that are low-resolution, overexposured, or contain extreme head poses. The storage requirements are minimal and a 3D hair model can be produced from an image in a second. Our evaluations also show that successful reconstructions are possible from highly stylized cartoon images, non-human subjects, and pictures taken from behind a person. Our approach is particularly well suited for continuous and plausible hair interpolation between very different hairstyles.;"[Saito, Shunsuke; Li, Hao] Univ Southern Calif, USC Inst Creat Technol, Pinscreen, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Hu, Liwen] Univ Southern Calif, Pinscreen, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ma, Chongyang; Luo, Linjie] Snap Inc, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Ibayashi, Hikaru] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA";;Saito, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, USC Inst Creat Technol, Pinscreen, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.;saitos@usc.edu;58;15;15;1;9;NOV;2018;37;6;;;208;10.1145/3272127.3275019;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275019;WOS:000455953100031;View Full Record in Web of Science

Such models lead to more profound interpretation of 2D images in which part-based parsing and assembling are involved. To this end, we learn a deep neural network which takes a single-view RGB image as input, and outputs a 3D shape in parts represented by 3D point clouds with an array of 3D part generators. In particular, we devise two levels of generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate shapes with both correct part shape and reasonable overall structure. To enable a self-taught network training, we devise a differentiable projection module along with a self-projection loss measuring the error between the shape projection and the input image. The training data in our method is unpaired between the 2D images and the 3D shapes with part decomposition. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations on public datasets, we show that our method achieves good performance in part-wise single-view reconstruction.;"[Niu, Chengjie; Yu, Yang; Bian, Zhenwei; Li, Jun; Xu, Kai] Natl Univ Def Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China";;Xu, K (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;kevin.kai.xu@gmail.com;50;0;0;5;10;OCT;2020;39;7;447;457;;10.1111/cgf.14158;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14158;WOS:000594502700038;View Full Record in Web of Science

In scientific visualization, TSR-VFD is the first work that leverages deep neural nets to interpolate intermediate vector fields from temporally sparsely sampled unsteady vector fields. The core of TSR-VFD lies in using two networks: InterpolationNet and MaskNet, that process the vector components of different scales from sampled vector fields as input and jointly output synthesized intermediate vector fields. To demonstrate our approach's effectiveness, we report qualitative and quantitative results with several data sets and compare TSR-VFD against vector field interpolation using linear interpolation (LERP), generative adversarial network (GAN), and recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, we compare TSR-VFD with a lossy compression (LC) scheme. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate critical parameter settings and network designs.

Our framework couples a generative model of the connectomics data with a deep network that predicts behavioral scores. The generative component is a structurally-regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning (sr-DDL) model that decomposes the dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices into a collection of shared basis networks and time varying subject-specific loadings. We use the DTI tractography to regularize this matrix factorization and learn anatomically informed functional connectivity profiles. The deep component of our framework is an LSTM-ANN block, which uses the temporal evolution of the subject-specific srDDL loadings to predict multidimensional clinical characterizations. Our joint optimization strategy collectively estimates the basis networks, the subject-specific time-varying loadings, and the neural network weights. We validate our framework on a dataset of neurotypical individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to map to cognition and on a separate multi-score prediction task on individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a five-fold cross validation setting.

This novel framework relies on the implicit regularization provided by representing images as the output of generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. So far, DIP has been shown to be an effective approach when combined with classical and novel regularizers. Unfortunately, to obtain appropriate solutions, all the models proposed up to now require an accurate estimate of the regularization parameter. To overcome this difficulty, we consider a locally adapted regularized unconstrained model whose local regularization parameters are automatically estimated for additively separable regularizers. Moreover, we propose a novel constrained formulation in analogy to Morozov's discrepancy principle which enables the application of a broader range of regularizers. Both the unconstrained and the constrained models are solved via the proximal gradient descent-ascent method.

It utilizes the spreading-activation theory of human long-term memories from social psychology to extract information and graph-theoretic linguistic approximations supporting rational propositional inference and formalisms. Using an empirical case study we demonstrate the process of extracting linguistic concepts from data and training a Hopfield artificial neural network for semantic network classification. We further develop an agent-based computational model of network evolution in order to study the processes and patterns of collective semantic knowledge representation, introducing incidents of collapses in central network structures. Large ensembles of simulation replication experiments are conducted and the resulted networks are analyzed using a variety of estimation techniques. We show how collective social structure emerges from simple interactions among semantic categories. Our findings provide evidence of the significance of collapse and reorganization effects in the structure of collective social knowledge; the statistical importance of the within-factor interactions in network evolution, and; stochastic exploration of whole parameter spaces in large ensembles of simulation runs can reveal important self-organizing aspects of the system's behavior.

Different from traditional steganography, deep learning-based steganography has an adaptable and generalized framework without needing expertise regarding the embedding process. However, most steganography algorithms utilize images as covers instead of videos, which are more expressive and more widely spread. To this end, an end-to-end deep learning network for video steganography is proposed in this paper. A multiscale down-sampling feature extraction structure is designed, which consists of three parts including an encoder, a decoder, and a discriminator network. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the learning ability of network, a CU (coding unit) mask built from a VVC (versatile video coding) video is first introduced. In addition, an attention mechanism is used to further promote the visual quality. The experimental results show that the proposed steganography network can achieve a better performance in terms of the perceptual quality of stego videos, decoding the accuracy of hidden messages, and the relatively high embedding capacity compared with the state-of-the-art steganography networks.;"[Chai, Huanhuan; Li, Zhaohong] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Li, Fan] Tianjin Univ, Dept Informat & Intelligent Engn, Renai Coll, Tianjin 301636, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhenzhen] Beijing Inst Graph Commun, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China";;Li, ZH (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.;"19120001@bjtu.edu.cn; zhhli2@bjtu.edu.cn; lifan000111@outlook.com; zhangzhenzhen@bigc.edu.cn";37;0;0;4;4;APR;2022;11;7;;;1142;10.3390/electronics11071142;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11071142;WOS:000781938900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Persistent homology is one of the most important tools of TDA, as it can extract the topological features hidden in a point cloud. However, the time-consuming computation of persistence diagrams severely limits the application of TDA. In this study, we propose an end-to-end TopologyNet that directly fits the output of the topological representations from the input point cloud data. TopologyNet significantly reduces the computation time of producing topological representations compared with the traditional pipeline, while maintaining a small approximating error in practical instances.

Having insight into the movement of pedestrians is crucial for ensuring safe operation in a variety of applications including autonomous vehicles, social robots, and environmental monitoring. Current works in this area utilize complex generative or recurrent methods to capture many possible futures. However, despite the inherent real-time nature of predicting future paths, little work has been done to explore accurate and computationally efficient approaches for this task. To this end, we propose a convolutional approach for real-time pedestrian path prediction, CARP(e). It utilizes a variation of Graph Isomorphism Networks in combination with an agile convolutional neural network design to form a fast and accurate path prediction approach. Notable results in both inference speed and prediction accuracy are achieved, improving FPS considerably in comparison to current state-of-the-art methods while delivering competitive accuracy on well-known path prediction datasets.;"[Mendieta, Matias; Tabkhi, Hamed] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA";;Mendieta, M (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.;"mmendiet@uncc.edu; htabkhiv@uncc.edu";41;0;0;0;1;;2021;35;;2346;2354;;;;WOS:000680423502050;View Full Record in Web of Science

There are numerous algorithms that rely on a variety of assumptions such as local smoothness to tackle this ill-posed problem. However, such priors lead to loss of important features and geometric detail. Instead, we propose a novel data-driven approach for point cloud consolidation via a convolutional neural network based technique. Our method takes a sparse and noisy point cloud as input, and produces a dense point cloud accurately representing the underlying surface by resolving ambiguities in geometry. The resulting point set can then be used to reconstruct accurate manifold surfaces and estimate surface properties. To achieve this, we propose a generative neural network architecture that can input and output point clouds, unlocking a powerful set of tools from the deep learning literature. We use this architecture to apply convolutional neural networks to local patches of geometry for high quality and efficient point cloud consolidation. This results in significantly more accurate surfaces, as we illustrate with a diversity of examples and comparisons to the state-of-the-art.;"[Roveri, Riccardo; Oztireli, A.

However, in actual applications, there is just a few annotated samples and a large number of unannotated samples in remote-sensing images, which leads to overfitting of the deep model and affects the performance of scene classification. In order to address these problems, a semi-supervised representation consistency Siamese network (SS-RCSN) is proposed for remote-sensing image scene classification. First, considering intraclass diversity and interclass similarity of remote-sensing images, Involution-generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to extract the discriminative features from remote-sensing images via unsupervised learning. Then, Siamese network with a representation consistency loss is proposed for semi-supervised classification, which aims to reduce the differences of labeled and unlabeled data.

However, additional relational knowledge between the semantic units within the input text may also play a critical role in the inference process. To equip the pretrained language models with the relational knowledge, previous methods employ a retrieval-based strategy, which obtain the relational features from prebuilt knowledge bases by a lookup operation. However, the inherent sparsity of part of the knowledge bases would prevent the direct retrieval of the relational features. To address this issue, we propose a MIX-strategy based Structural commonsense integration framework (Mix-Sci). In addition to the traditional retrieval strategy which only adapts to the knowledge bases with high coverage, Mix-Sci introduces an additional generative strategy to incorporate the sparse knowledge bases with the pretrained language models. In specific, in the training process, Mix-Sci learns to generate the structural information of the knowledge base, including the embedding of nodes and the connection relationship between the nodes. So that in the test process, the structural information can be generated to enhance the inference process. Experimental results on two textual inference tasks: machine reading comprehension and event prediction show that Mix-Sci can effectively utilize both the dense and the sparse knowledge bases, to consistently improve the performance of pretrained language models on textual inference tasks.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Since AD starts several years before the onset of the symptoms, its early detection is challenging due to subtle changes in biomarkers mainly detectable in different neuroimaging modalities. Developing computer-aided diagnostic models based on deep learning can provide excellent opportunities for the analysis of different neuroimage modalities along with other non-image biomarkers. In this survey, we perform a comparative analysis of about 100 published papers since 2019 that employ basic deep architectures such as CNN, RNN, and generative models for AD diagnosis. Moreover, about 60 papers that have applied a trending topic or architecture for AD are investigated. Explainable models, normalizing flows, graph-based deep architectures, self-supervised learning, and attention mechanisms are considered. The main challenges in this body of literature have been categorized and explained from data-related, methodology-related, and clinical adoption aspects.

However, generative models have limited capacity to handle rich sensory observations, such as camera images, since they must model the entire distribution over sensor readings. Discriminative models do not suffer from this limitation, but are typically more complex to train as latent variable models for state estimation. We present an alternative approach where the parameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as a deterministic computation graph, resulting in a simple and effective gradient descent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show that this procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input, such as raw camera images, which must be processed using expressive nonlinear function approximators such as convolutional neural networks. Our model can be viewed as a type of recurrent neural network, and the connection to probabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that is particularly well suited for state estimation. We evaluate our approach on synthetic tracking task with raw image inputs and on the visual odometry task in the KITTI dataset.

State-of-the-art deformation transfer methods require either point-wise correspondences between source and target shapes, or pairs of deformed source and target shapes with corresponding deformations. However, in most cases, such correspondences are not available and cannot be reliably established using an automatic algorithm. Therefore, substantial user effort is needed to label the correspondences or to obtain and specify such shape sets. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatic deformation transfer between two unpaired shape sets without correspondences. 3D deformation is represented in a high-dimensional space. To obtain a more compact and effective representation, two convolutional variational autoencoders are learned to encode source and target shapes to their latent spaces. We exploit a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to map deformed source shapes to deformed target shapes, both in the latent spaces, which ensures the obtained shapes from the mapping are indistinguishable from the target shapes. This is still an under-constrained problem, so we further utilize a reverse mapping from target shapes to source shapes and incorporate cycle consistency loss, i.e. applying both mappings should reverse to the input shape. This VAE-Cycle GAN (VC-GAN) architecture is used to build a reliable mapping between shape spaces. Finally, a similarity constraint is employed to ensure the mapping is consistent with visual similarity, achieved by learning a similarity neural network that takes the embedding vectors from the source and target latent spaces and predicts the light field distance between the corresponding shapes. Experimental results show that our fully automatic method is able to obtain high-quality deformation transfer results with unpaired data sets, comparable or better than existing methods where strict correspondences are required.;"[Gao, Lin; Yang, Jie; Xia, Shihong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing Key Lab Mobile Comp & Pervas Device, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jie; Qiao, Yi-Ling] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Yi-Ling] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lai, Yu-Kun; Rosin, Paul L.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Xu, Weiwei] Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab CAD&CG, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China";;Xia, SH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Beijing Key Lab Mobile Comp & Pervas Device, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"gaolin@ict.ac.cn; yangjie01@ict.ac.cn; qiaoyiling15@mails.ucas.ac.cn; LaiY4@cardiff.ac.uk; RosinPL@cardiff.ac.uk; xww@cad.zju.edu.cn; xsh@ict.ac.cn";59;22;24;1;12;NOV;2018;37;6;;;237;10.1145/3272127.3275028;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275028;WOS:000455953100060;View Full Record in Web of Science

Once trained, LOGAN takes a shape from one domain and transforms it into the other. Our network consists of an autoencoder to encode shapes from the two input domains into a common latent space, where the latent codes concatenate multi-scale shape features, resulting in an overcomplete representation. The translator is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), operating in the latent space, where an adversarial loss enforces cross-domain translation while a feature preservation loss ensures that the right shape features are preserved for a natural shape transform. We conduct ablation studies to validate each of our key network designs and demonstrate superior capabilities in unpaired shape transforms on a variety of examples over baselines and state-of-the-art approaches.

Recently, learning-based approaches have emerged that reduce the registration of new scans to running inference with a previously-trained model. The potential benefits are multifold: inference is typically orders of magnitude faster than solving a new instance of a difficult optimization problem, deep learning models can be made robust to noise and corruption, and the trained model may be re-used for other tasks, e.g. through transfer learning. In this paper, we cast the registration task as a surface-to-surface translation problem, and design a model to reliably capture the latent geometric information directly from raw 3D face scans. We introduce Shape-My-Face (SMF), a powerful encoder-decoder architecture based on an improved point cloud encoder, a novel visual attention mechanism, graph convolutional decoders with skip connections, and a specialized mouth model that we smoothly integrate with the mesh convolutions. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art learning algorithms for non-rigid registration of face scans, SMF only requires the raw data to be rigidly aligned (with scaling) with a pre-defined face template. Additionally, our model provides topologically-sound meshes with minimal supervision, offers faster training time, has orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters, is more robust to noise, and can generalize to previously unseen datasets. We extensively evaluate the quality of our registrations on diverse data. We demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our model with in-the-wild face scans across different modalities, sensor types, and resolutions.

Most of the recent 3D face reconstruction methods aim to embed the 3D morphable basis functions into Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). However, balancing the requirements of strong regularization for global shape and weak regularization for high level details is still illposed. To address this problem, we properly control generality and specificity in terms of regularization by harnessing the power of uncertainty. Additionally, we focus on the concept of nonlinearity and find out that Graph Convolutional Neural Network (Graph CNN) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) are effective in reconstructing high quality 3D shapes and textures respectively. In this paper, we propose to employ (i) an uncertainty-aware encoder that presents face features as distributions and (ii) a fully nonlinear decoder model combining Graph CNN with GAN.

The main contribution of this work is a generative neural network architecture whose input is a range scan of a 3D object and whose output is an indexed face set conditioned on the input scan. In order to generate a 3D mesh as a set of vertices and face indices, the generative model builds on a series of proxy losses for vertices, edges, and faces. At each stage, we realize a one-to-one discrete mapping between the predicted and ground truth data points with a combination of convolutional- and graph neural network architectures. This enables our algorithm to predict a compact mesh representation similar to those created through manual artist effort using 3D modeling software. Our generated mesh results thus produce sharper, cleaner meshes with a fundamentally different structure from those generated through implicit functions, a first step in bridging the gap towards artist-created CAD models.;"[Dai, Angela; Niessner, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany";;Dai, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.;;34;25;25;0;0;;2019;;;5559;5568;;10.1109/CVPR.2019.00572;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2019.00572;WOS:000529484005076;View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to this severe security risk, morph detection systems do not only need to be robust against classical landmark-based face morphing approach (LMA), but also future attacks such as neural network based morph generation techniques. The focus of this paper lies on an experimental evaluation of the morph detection capabilities of various state-of-the-art morph detectors with respect to a recently presented novel face morphing approach, MorGAN, which is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this work, existing detection algorithms are confronted with different attack scenarios: known and unknown attacks comprising different morph types (LMA and MorGAN). The detectors' performance results are highly dependent on the features used by the detection algorithms. In addition, the image quality of the morphed face images produced with the MorGAN approach is assessed using well-established no-reference image quality metrics and compared to LMA morphs. The results indicate that the image quality of MorGAN morphs is more similar to bona fide images compared to classical LMA morphs.;"[Debiasi, Luca; Uhl, Andreas] Univ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria; [Damer, Naser; Saladie, Alexandra Mosegui; Kirchbuchner, Florian] Fraunhofer Inst Comp Graph Res IGD, Darmstadt, Germany; [Damer, Naser] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany; [Rathgeb, Christian; Scherhag, Ulrich; Busch, Christoph] Hsch Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany";;Debiasi, L (corresponding author), Univ Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.;"ldebiasi@cs.sbg.ac.at; naser.darner@igd.fraunhofer.de; alexamosegui93@gmail.com; christian.rathgeb@h-da.de; ulrich.scherhag@h-da.de; christoph.busch@h-da.de; florian.kirchbuchner@igd.fraunhofer.de; uhl@cs.sbg.ac.at";23;8;8;1;5;;2019;11752;;345;356;;10.1007/978-3-030-30645-8_32;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30645-8_32;WOS:000562008400030;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation and show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Because the network learns a semantic change, a sequence of meaningful intermediate images can be generated without requiring the user to specify explicit correspondences. In addition, the semantic change learning makes it possible to perform the morphing between the images that contain objects with significantly different poses or camera views. Furthermore, just as in conventional morphing techniques, our morphing network can handle shape and appearance transitions separately by disentangling the content and the style transfer for rich usability. We prepare a training dataset for morphing using a pre-trained BigGAN, which generates an intermediate image by interpolating two latent vectors at an intended morphing value. This is the first attempt to address image morphing using a pre-trained generative model in order to learn semantic transformation. The experiments show that Neural Crossbreed produces high quality morphed images, overcoming various limitations associated with conventional approaches. In addition, Neural Crossbreed can be further extended for diverse applications such as multi-image morphing, appearance transfer, and video frame interpolation.;"[Park, Sanghun; Seo, Kwanggyoon; Noh, Junyong] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Visual Media Lab, Daejeon, South Korea";;Park, S (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Visual Media Lab, Daejeon, South Korea.;"reversi@kaist.ac.kr; skg1023@kaist.ac.kr; nohjunyong@kaist.ac.kr";62;1;1;0;3;DEC;2020;39;6;;;224;10.1145/3414685.3417797;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3414685.3417797;WOS:000595589100064;View Full Record in Web of Science

The existing techniques, like static and dynamic analysis, fail to mitigate newly generated malware. Also, the signature, behavior, and anomaly-based defense mechanisms are susceptible to obfuscation and polymorphism attacks. With machine learning in practice, several authors proposed different classification and visualization techniques for malware detection. Images have proved worth analyzing the behavior of malware. Deep neural networks extract much information from it without having expert domain knowledge. On the other hand, the scarcity of diverse malware data available with clients, and their privacy concerns about sharing data with a centralized curator makes it challenging to build a more reliable model. This paper proposes a lightweight Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based model extracting relevant features using call graph, n-gram, and image transformations. Further, Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN) is used for generating unseen data for training purposes. The model is extended for federated setup to build an effective malware detection system. We have used the Microsoft malware dataset for training and evaluation.

In this work, we evaluate the use of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) as a robust and potentially improved method for semantic segmentation compared to other extensively used convolutional neural network, such as the U-Net. As cGANs have not yet been widely explored for semantic medical image segmentation, we analysed the effect of training with different objective functions and discriminator receptive field sizes on the segmentation performance of the cGAN. Additionally, we evaluated the possibility of using transfer learning to improve the segmentation accuracy. The networks were trained on i) the SKI10 dataset which comes from the MICCAI grand challenge Segmentation of Knee Images 2010 '', ii) the OAI ZIB dataset containing femoral and tibial bone and cartilage segmentations of the Osteoarthritis Initiative cohort and iii) a small locally acquired dataset (Advanced MRI of Osteoarthritis (AMROA) study) consisting of 3D fat-saturated spoiled gradient recalled-echo knee MRIs with manual segmentations of the femoral, tibial and patellar bone and cartilage, as well as the cruciate ligaments and selected peri-articular muscles. The SOrensen-Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), volumetric overlap error (VOE) and average surface distance (ASD) were calculated for segmentation performance evaluation. DSC >= 0.95 were achieved for all segmented bone structures, DSC > 0.83 for cartilage and muscle tissues and DSC of approximate to 0.66 were achieved for cruciate ligament segmentations with both cGAN and U-Net on the in-house AMROA dataset. Reducing the receptive field size of the cGAN discriminator network improved the networks segmentation performance and resulted in segmentation accuracies equivalent to those of the U-Net. Pretraining not only increased segmentation accuracy of a few knee joint tissues of the fine-tuned dataset, but also increased the network's capacity to preserve segmentation capabilities for the pretrained dataset. cGAN machine learning can generate automated semantic maps of multiple tissues within the knee joint which could increase the accuracy and efficiency for evaluating joint health.;"[Kessler, Dimitri A.; MacKay, James W.; Gilbert, Fiona J.; Kaggie, Joshua D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Radiol, Cambridge, England; [MacKay, James W.] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Crowe, Victoria A.; Graves, Martin J.] Cambridge Univ Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Addenbrookes Hosp, Cambridge, England; [Henson, Frances M.

In this paper, we supplement these limited samples with two inexhaustible data sources: the unlabeled records probed from a system in service, and the labeled data simulated in an emulation environment.

When using the traditional extrapolation method it is difficult to model highly nonlinear echo movements. The key challenge of the nowcasting mission lies in achieving high-precision radar echo extrapolation. In recent years, machine learning has made great progress in the extrapolation of weather radar echoes. However, most of models neglect the multi-modal characteristics of radar echo data, resulting in blurred and unrealistic prediction images. This paper aims to solve this problem by utilizing the features of a generative adversarial network (GAN), which can enhance multi-modal distribution modeling, and design the radar echo extrapolation model GAN-argcPredNet v1.0. The model is composed of an argcPredNet generator and a convolutional neural network discriminator. In the generator, a gate controlling the memory and output is designed in the rgcLSTM component, thereby reducing the loss of spatiotemporal information. In the discriminator, the model uses a dual-channel input method, which enables it to strictly score according to the true echo distribution, and it thus has a more powerful discrimination ability. Through experiments on a radar dataset from Shenzhen, China, the results show that the radar echo hit rate (probability of detection; POD) and critical success index (CSI) have an average increase of 21.4 % and 19 %, respectively, compared with rgcPredNet under different intensity rainfall thresholds, and the false alarm rate (FAR) has decreased by an average of 17.9 %. We also found a problem during the comparison of the result graph and the evaluation index. The recursive prediction method will produce the phenomenon that the prediction result will gradually deviate from the true value over time.

These visual quantities play an important role in user interactions: Being familiar and meaningful to humans, these quantities have a strong correlation with the underlying motion. We propose a novel data-driven conditional adversarial model that solves the challenging and theoretically ill-posed problem of deriving plausible velocity fields from a single frame of a density field. Besides density modifications, our generative model is the first to enable the control of the results using all of the following control modalities: obstacles, physical parameters, kinetic energy, and vorticity. Our method is based on a new conditional generative adversarial neural network that explicitly embeds physical quantities into the learned latent space, and a new cyclic adversarial network design for control disentanglement.

We focus on two under-explored practical challenges arising in such settings: (i) Each task may have a different subset of sensors, i.e., providing different partial observations of the underlying 'system'. This restriction can be due to different manufacturers in the former case, and people wearing more or less measurement devices in the latter (ii) We are not allowed to store or re-access data from a task once it has been observed at the task level. This may be due to privacy considerations in the case of people, or legal restrictions placed by machine owners. Nevertheless, we would like to (a) improve performance on subsequent tasks using experience from completed tasks as well as (b) continue to perform better on past tasks, e.g., update the model and improve predictions on even the first machine after learning from subsequently observed ones. We note that existing continual learning methods do not take into account variability in input dimensions arising due to different subsets of sensors being available across tasks, and struggle to adapt to such variable input dimensions (VID) tasks. In this work, we address this shortcoming of existing methods. To this end, we learn task-specific generative models and classifiers, and use these to augment data for target tasks. Since the input dimensions across tasks vary, we propose a novel conditioning module based on graph neural networks to aid a standard recurrent neural network. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach on three publicly available datasets corresponding to two activity recognition tasks (classification) and one prognostics task (regression).

Reconstruction of SVBRDFs is a long-standing problem. Existing methods either rely on an extensive acquisition system or require huge datasets, which are non-trivial to acquire. We aim to recover SVBRDFs from a single image, without any datasets. A single image contains incomplete information about the SVBRDF, making the reconstruction task highly ill-posed. It is also difficult to separate between the changes in colour that are caused by the material and those caused by the illumination, without the prior knowledge learned from the dataset. In this paper, we use an unsupervised generative adversarial neural network (GAN) to recover SVBRDFs maps with a single image as input. To better separate the effects due to illumination from the effects due to the material, we add the hypothesis that the material is stationary and introduce a new loss function based on Fourier coefficients to enforce this stationarity. For efficiency, we train the network in two stages: reusing a trained model to initialize the SVBRDFs and fine-tune it based on the input image. Our method generates high-quality SVBRDFs maps from a single input photograph, and provides more vivid rendering results compared to the previous work. The two-stage training boosts runtime performance, making it eight times faster than the previous work.;"[Wen, Tao; Wang, Beibei] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Beibei; Zhang, Lei] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jie] Nanjing Univ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Holzschuch, Nicolas] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LJK, Grenoble INP, CNRS,INRIA, Grenoble, France";;Wen, T (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;;27;0;0;2;2;;;;;;;;10.1111/cgf.14514;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14514;WOS:000796369500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although neural-network-based generative models for character animation are capable of learning expressive, compact controllers from vast amounts of animation data, methods such as Motion Matching still remain a popular choice in the games industry due to their flexibility, predictability, low pre-processing time, and visual quality - all properties which can sometimes be difficult to achieve with neural-network-based methods. Yet, unlike neural networks, the memory usage of such methods generally scales linearly with the amount of data used, resulting in a constant trade-off between the diversity of animation which can be produced and real world production budgets. In this work we combine the benefits of both approaches and, by breaking down the Motion Matching algorithm into its individual steps, show how learned, scalable alternatives can be used to replace each operation in turn. Our final model has no need to store animation data or additional matching meta-data in memory, meaning it scales as well as existing generative models.

However, most methods neglected the connotative relation and extensional relation between the action classes, which leads to the poor generalization ability of the zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the learned classifier inclines to predict the samples of seen class, which leads to poor classification performance. To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stage deep neural network for zero-shot action recognition, which consists of a feature generation sub-network serving as the sampling stage and a graph attention sub-network serving as the classification stage. In the sampling stage, we utilize generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained by action features and word vectors of seen classes to synthesize the action features of unseen classes, which can balance the training sample data of seen classes and unseen classes. In the classification stage, we construct a knowledge graph (KG) based on the relationship between word vectors of action classes and related objects, and propose a graph convolution network (GCN) based on attention mechanism, which dynamically updates the relationship between action classes and objects, and enhances the generalization ability of zero-shot learning. In both stages, we all use word vectors as bridges for feature generation and classifier generalization from seen classes to unseen classes. We compare our method with state-of-theart methods on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the classification performance of the trained classifier and achieves higher accuracy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the non-rigid registration between different CMR sequences is particularly challenging and prevents the use of multi-sequence image analysis. In this article, we propose an approach for segmenting T2 and DE CMR simultaneously with cross-constrained shape and shape discrepancy compensation. A framework for the unified segmentation of multi-sequence images is built based on the coupled level set method. Additionally, a sparse representation-based shape model is optimized under the constraints from both sequences for complementary information sharing. Considering the myocardium shape discrepancy between the two sequences due to non-perfect registration, an error term is added to explicitly model this difference. The intensity feature is extracted with a Gaussian mixture model from each sequence. To obtain a fully automatic approach, the conditional generative adversarial network is adopted for initialization. The results are evaluated with T2 and DE images from 32 MI patients. A promising Dice similarity coefficient of the myocardium is achieved (84.97 +/- 4.15% for T2 and 78.13 +/- 6.22% for DE CMR).

The use of motion capture and retargeting has arguably become the dominant solution to address this demand. Yet, despite high level of quality and automation performance-based animation pipelines still require manual cleaning and editing to refine raw results, which is a time- and skill-demanding process.

Inspired by recent image inpainting methods, we design a generative recurrent neural network that generates realistic motion into designated segments of an existing facial animation, optionally following user-provided guiding constraints.

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods.

In computational neuroscience, there have been some attempts to formalize connectionist notations and generative operations for neural networks, including Connection Set Algebra, but none are truly formal or general. In computational intelligence (CI), though the use of linear algebra and tensor-based models are widespread, graph-based frameworks are also popular and there is a lack of tools supporting the transfer of information between systems. To address these gaps, we exploited existing results about the connection between linear and relation algebras to define a concise, formal algebraic framework that generalizes graph and tensor-based neural networks. For simplicity and compatibility, this framework is purposefully defined as a minimal extension to linear algebra. We demonstrate the merits of this approach first by defining new operations for network composition along with proofs of their most important properties. An implementation of the algebraic framework is presented and applied to create an instance of an artificial neural network that is compatible with both graph and tensor based CI frameworks. The result is an algebraic framework for neural networks that generalizes the formats used in at least two systems, together with an example implementation.;"[Jackson, Ethan C.; Hughes, James Alexander; Daley, Mark] Univ Western Ontario, Comp Sci Dept, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Winter, Michael] Brock Univ, Comp Sci Dept, St Catharines, ON L2S 3A1, Canada";;Jackson, EC (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Comp Sci Dept, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.;"ejacks42@uwo.ca; jhughe54@uwo.ca; mdaley2@uwo.ca; mwinter@brocku.ca";16;1;1;0;0;;2017;;;182;189;;;;WOS:000463852500029;View Full Record in Web of Science

While it is well-accepted that agent interactions play an essential role in synthesizing such scenes, most extant techniques exclusively focus on static scenes, leaving the dynamic component out. In this paper, we present a generative model to synthesize plausible multi-step dynamic human-object interactions. Generating multi-step interactions is challenging since the space of such interactions is exponential in the number of objects, activities, and time steps. We propose to handle this combinatorial complexity by learning a lower dimensional space of plausible human-object interactions. We use action plots to represent interactions as a sequence of discrete actions along with the participating objects and their states. To build action plots, we present an automatic method that uses state-of-the-art computer vision techniques on RGB videos in order to detect individual objects and their states, extract the involved hands, and recognize the actions performed. The action plots are built from observing videos of everyday activities and are used to train a generative model based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The network learns the causal dependencies and constraints between individual actions and can be used to generate novel and diverse multi-step human-object interactions. Our representation and generative model allows new capabilities in a variety of applications such as interaction prediction, animation synthesis, and motion planning for a real robotic agent.;"[Wang, He; Pirk, Soren; Sridhar, Srinath; Guibas, Leonidas J.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Yumer, Ersin] Uber ATG, San Francisco, CA USA; [Kim, Vladimir G.] Adobe Res, San Jose, CA USA; [Sener, Ozan] Intel Labs, Hillsboro, OR USA";;Wang, H (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;;60;9;9;1;9;MAY;2019;38;2;367;378;;10.1111/cgf.13644;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13644;WOS:000471634300031;View Full Record in Web of Science

Collective contextual anomalies (CCAs) carry the characteristics of both collective and contextual anomalies. This type of anomalies is common in IT system monitoring, often manifested as security risks to be ameliorated, service outages to be eliminated, or stragglers to be mitigated. However, most existing studies emphasize primarily on the detection of point anomalies while the prediction or early detection of CCA has been an underexplored topic. In this paper, we propose a framework for discovering and studying CCAs in multiple time series based on a combination of semi-supervised deep learning, time series modeling, and graph analysis. A primary advantage of the proposed framework is that it can effectively predict CCAs with no human intervention. In addition, the performance of the proposed method can be further enhanced via learning from a small amount of anomalous training data, if it is available. Finally, the proposed framework is of low computational complexity and is thus particularly suitable for large-scale data streams. Simulation studies are carried out to reveal the superior performance of the proposed method and underscore the significant benefits of combining deep neural networks with time series analysis and graph models for the prediction and analysis of CCAs.;"[Dou, Shaoyu; Yang, Kai] Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Dou, Shaoyu; Yang, Kai] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Autonomous Intelligent Unmanned Syst Sci, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Poor, H.

Then, in the second step, conditioned on the material code, our method produces an infinite and diverse spatial field of BRDF model parameters (diffuse albedo, normals, roughness, specular albedo) that subsequently allows rendering in complex scenes and illuminations, matching the appearance of the input photograph. Technically, we jointly embed all flash images into a latent space using a convolutional encoder, and -conditioned on these latent codes- convert random spatial fields into fields of BRDF parameters using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We condition these BRDF parameters to match the visual characteristics (statistics and spectra of visual features) of the input under matching light.

Our key observation is that indoor scene structures are inherently hierarchical. Hence, our network is not convolutional; it is a recursive neural network, or RvNN. Using a dataset of annotated scene hierarchies, we train a variational recursive autoencoder, or RvNN-VAE, which performs scene object grouping during its encoding phase and scene generation during decoding. Specifically, a set of encoders are recursively applied to group 3D objects based on support, surround, and co-occurrence relations in a scene, encoding information about objects' spatial properties, semantics, and relative positioning with respect to other objects in the hierarchy. By training a variational autoencoder (VAE), the resulting fixed-length codes roughly follow a Gaussian distribution. A novel 3D scene can be generated hierarchically by the decoder from a randomly sampled code from the learned distribution. We coin our method GRAINS, for Generative Recursive Autoencoders for INdoor Scenes.

Although human head modeling has been researched for a long time, few works have focused on animal-like heads, which are of more diverse shapes and richer geometric details. In this article, we present SAniHead, an interactive system for creating animal-like heads with a mesh representation from dual-view sketches. Our core technical contribution is a view-surface collaborative mesh generative network. Initially, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) is trained to learn the deformation of a template mesh to fit the shape of sketches, giving rise to a coarse model. It is then projected into vertex maps where image-to-image translation networks are performed for detail inference. After back-projecting the inferred details onto the meshed surface, a new GCNN is trained for further detail refinement. The modules of view-based detail inference and surface-based detail refinement are conducted in an alternating cascaded fashion, collaboratively improving the model. A refinement sketching interface is also implemented to support direct mesh manipulation. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach and the usability of our interactive system.

Recently, utilizing deep neural networks to generate 3D data has attracted increasing attention in the research community. Generative models of point clouds are used extensively for many tasks ranging from upsampling to shape completion or reconstruction. Our work addresses 3D reconstruction from a latent representation, generating a particular output corresponding to the ground truth point cloud. It is well known that graph convolutional networks (GCNs) require a tremendous amount of computational complexity to compute the graph connectivity dynamically. To reduce this, a simulated genetic (SG) layer is introduced in the generator of the GeneCGAN from a heredity perspective. It performs within a hierarchical rooted tree by leveraging ancestor information and neighbor relationships. Moreover, with a prior fusing operation, global features regarded as the conditional information are added to the root node in a hierarchical rooted tree for learning a conditional probability distribution of the input datasets. It leads to a controllable point cloud output.

Existing methods mainly protect the privacy by adding occlusion or noise to the original images before uploading, which is either impractical or destroying the utility of the photos. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based image privacy protection algorithm PriGAN, which generates a privacy image for each original image to fool the recognition networks. When generating the privacy image, we consider the technique of adversarial image perturbations (AIP), which could confuse recognition networks with slight perturbations. That is, the privacy image could protect the privacy information by confusing the neural network hosted by the service providers. Meanwhile, the privacy image appears unmodified compared to the original one for human observers, and thus its utility could be preserved. The advantage of PriGAN is that it provides a general privacy protection framework for personal applications, by which privacy information of images can be protected without destroying the image utility. The experiment shows that the privacy images are misclassified with approximate 82.9% higher than the original images which indicate that our approach can prevent the privacy from leakage with considerable improvement.;"[He, Yuwen; Zhang, Chunhong; Zhu, Xinning; Ji, Yang] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China";;He, YW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Universal Wireless Commun, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;"qiangweiyiyi@bupt.edu.cn; zhangch@bupt.edu.cn; zhuxn@bupt.edu.cn; jiyangbupt@gmail.com";41;7;7;1;6;;2019;11069;;;;1106927;10.1117/12.2524274;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2524274;WOS:000485096200077;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it has proved challenging to control the design process or incorporate prior knowledge, limiting their practical use in drug discovery. In particular, generative methods have made limited use of three-dimensional (3D) structural information even though this is critical to binding. This work describes a method to incorporate such information and demonstrates the benefit of doing so. We combine an existing graph-based deep generative model, DeLinker, with a convolutional neural network to utilise physically-meaningful 3D representations of molecules and target pharmacophores. We apply our model, DEVELOP, to both linker and R-group design, demonstrating its suitability for both hit-to-lead and lead optimisation. The 3D pharmacophoric information results in improved generation and allows greater control of the design process. In multiple large-scale evaluations, we show that including 3D pharmacophoric constraints results in substantial improvements in the quality of generated molecules. On a challenging test set derived from PDBbind, our model improves the proportion of generated molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule by over 300%. In addition, DEVELOP recovers 10x more of the original molecules compared to the baseline DeLinker method. Our approach is general-purpose, readily modifiable to alternate 3D representations, and can be incorporated into other generative frameworks.

Non-invasive neuroimaging methods are disease markers that can be used to help diagnose ASD. The majority of available techniques in the literature use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect ASD with a small dataset, resulting in high accuracy but low generality. Traditional supervised machine learning classification algorithms such as support vector machines function well with unstructured and semi structured data such as text, images, and videos, but their performance and robustness are restricted by the size of the accompanying training data. Deep learning on the other hand creates an artificial neural network that can learn and make intelligent judgments on its own by layering algorithms. It takes use of plentiful low-cost computing and many approaches are focused with very big datasets that are concerned with creating far larger and more sophisticated neural networks. Generative modelling, also known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is an unsupervised deep learning task that entails automatically discovering and learning regularities or patterns in input data in order for the model to generate or output new examples that could have been drawn from the original dataset. GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field that delivers on the promise of generative models in terms of their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks and hasn't been explored much for Autism spectrum disorder prediction in the past. In this paper, we present a novel conditional generative adversarial network, or cGAN for short, which is a form of GAN that uses a generator model to conditionally generate images. In terms of prediction and accuracy, they outperform the standard GAN. The proposed model is 74% more accurate than the traditional methods and takes only around 10 min for training even with a huge dataset.;"[Raja, K.

GAN typically uses a new type of neural network called deconvolutional neural network (DCNN). To implement DCNN in hardware, the state-of-the-art DCNN accelerator optimizes the dataflow using DCNN-to-CNN conversion method. However, this method still requires high computational complexity because the number of feature maps is increased when converted from DCNN to CNN. Recently, pruning has been recognized as an effective solution to reduce the high computational complexity and huge network model size. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse DCNN accelerator (SDCNN) combining these approaches on FPGA. First, we propose a novel dataflow suitable for the sparse DCNN acceleration by loop transformation. Then, we introduce a four stage pipeline for generating the SDCNN model. Finally, we propose an efficient architecture based on SDCNN dataflow.

In this paper, we propose Khaos, a novel DGA with high anti-detection ability based on neural language models and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The key insight of our research is that real domain names are composed of readable syllables and acronyms, and thus we can arrange syllables and acronyms using neural language models to mimic real domain names. In Khaos, we first find the most common -grams from real domain names. We carry out experiments using a variety of state-of-the-art DGA detection approaches: the statistics-based, the distribution-based, the LSTM-based and the graph-based detection approach. Our experimental results show that the average distance for detecting Khaos under the distribution-based detection approach is 0.64, the AUCs of Khaos under the statistics-based and the LSTM-based detection approach are 0.76 and 0.57, respectively, and the precision of Khaos under the graph-based detection approach is 0.68. Our work proves that the existing detection approaches have big troubles in detecting Khaos, and Khaos has better anti-detection ability than state-of-the-art DGAs.

However, the inverse design of metamaterial and its multiscale system is challenging due to high-dimensional topological design space, multiple local optima, and high computational cost. To address these hurdles, we propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep generative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for property prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and organized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation between microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in geometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven methods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and multiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical properties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by simple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further extended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of mechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly generated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then assembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure compatibility between adjacent microstructures. We demonstrate our framework by designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial systems that achieve desired distortion behaviors.

The addition of synthetic noise to the learning set finds some similarity with data augmentation approaches that are currently adopted in many deep learning strategies. With the graph-based approach, however, it is possible to direct resample in the margin region instead of exhaustively cover the whole input space. The goal is to train neural networks with added noise in the margin region, located by structural information extracted from a planar graph. The so-called structural vectors, which are the training set vertices near the class boundary, are obtained from the structural information using Gabriel Graph. Synthetic samples are added to the learning set around the geometric vectors, improving generalization performance. A mathematical formulation that shows that the addition of synthetic samples has the same effect as the Tikhonov regularization is presented. Friedman and pos-hoc Nemenyi tests indicate that outcomes from the proposed method are statistically equivalent to the ones obtained by objective-function regularization, implying that both methods yield smoother solutions, reducing the effects of overfitting.;"[Assis, Alex D.] Univ Fed Juiz de Fora UFJF, Dept Econ, BR-35010180 Governador Valadares, Brazil; [Assis, Alex D.; Araujo, Lourencro R.

There are two different methods for colorization. The interaction-based colorization method can generate results based on user interaction. However, this method requires considerable artificial interaction to achieve the desired results. Another method is automatic colorization based on deep learning. However, in this case, the colorization result is unique and cannot be adjusted if the result is incorrect or if the user has additional requirements. In this paper, we combine deep learning with user interaction and propose a grayscale image colorization method based on generative adversarial networks. In this method, a full convolutional neural network is constructed based on the U-net structure as a generator that can process images of any size. The training data is automatically generated by randomly simulating the interactive strokes. The experimental results indicate that this approach can efficiently achieve good colorization results and is capable of generating results based on different user interactions.;"[Wang, Kai; Li, Jianwei; Zhou, Bin] Beihang Univ, State Key Lab Virtual Real Technol & Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Bin] Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen, Peoples R China";;"Zhou, B (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, State Key Lab Virtual Real Technol & Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, B (corresponding author), Peng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.";"cesar@buaa.edu.cn; jianwei.li@buaa.edu.cn; zhoubin@buaa.edu.cn";0;0;0;0;2;;2019;;;1;6;;10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00009;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00009;WOS:000627828900001;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;Lang, XM;;;Lang, Xianming;Recognition Method of Pipeline Weld Defects Based on Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks;IEEE INSTRUMENTATION & MEASUREMENT MAGAZINE;;English;Article;;;;"Training data; Time-frequency analysis; Magnetic flux leakage; Data integrity; Neural networks";;This study aims to address the problem of poorly generated data quality and slow network training speed in data augmentation of 1-dimensional time domain signals. A data augmentation method for the generative adversarial network based on the time-frequency graph of magnetic flux leakage (MFL) signals is proposed. First, the original MFL is converted into a time-frequency signal graph, which is suitable for the input data of the conventional neural network. Second, to produce an adversarial network combined with auxiliary classification, the label of the original MFL signal is used as the input of this network for data augmentation. Compared with a 1-dimensional time domain signal data augmentation method, the proposed method effectively reduces the number of network training parameters and simultaneously solves the problem of slow training speed in traditional methods. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the identification of MFL signals collected by a pipeline company. The experimental results show that the proposed method can produce higher-quality data and effectively improve the accuracy of weld defect magnetic leakage signal recognition and the speed of network training, while the accuracy rate of magnetic leakage signal recognition is increased from 94.5% of the traditional method to 99.5%, which is feasible for practical engineering applications.;"[Lang, Xianming] Northeastern Univ, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Lang, Xianming] Liaoning Petrochem Univ, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Shenyang, Peoples R China";;"Lang, XM (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Shenyang, Peoples R China.;Lang, XM (corresponding author), Liaoning Petrochem Univ, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Shenyang, Peoples R China.";langxianming@mail.nwpu.edu.cn;21;0;0;6;6;APR;2022;25;2;69;77;;10.1109/MIM.2022.9756386;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIM.2022.9756386;WOS:000792745000016;View Full Record in Web of Science
