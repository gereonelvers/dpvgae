However, training GNNs usually requires abundant task-specific labeled data, which is often arduously expensive to obtain. One effective way to reduce the labeling effort is to pre-train an expressive GNN model on unlabeled data with self-supervision and then transfer the learned model to downstream tasks with only a few labels. In this paper, we present the GPT-GNN* framework to initialize GNNs by generative pre-training. GPT-GNN introduces a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to pre-train a GNN so that it can capture the structural and semantic properties of the graph. We factorize the likelihood of the graph generation into two components: 1) Attribute Generation and 2) Edge Generation. By modeling both components, GPT-GNN captures the inherent dependency between node attributes and graph structure during the generative process. Comprehensive experiments on the billion-scale Open Academic Graph and Amazon recommendation data demonstrate that GPT-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models without pre-training by up to 9.1% across various downstream tasks.;"[Hu, Ziniu; Chang, Kai-Wei; Sun, Yizhou] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Dong, Yuxiao; Wang, Kuansan] Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA";;Hu, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.;"bull@cs.ucla.edu; yuxdong@microsoft.com; kuansanw@microsoft.com; kwchang@cs.ucla.edu; yzsun@cs.ucla.edu";45;33;35;7;13;;2020;;;1857;1867;;10.1145/3394486.3403237;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3394486.3403237;WOS:000749552301084;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition to the data privacy issue, the efficiency of drug discovery is another key objective since infectious diseases spread exponentially and effectively conducting drug discovery could save lives. Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are promising to solve these problems: (1) Federated Learning (FL) is born to keep data privacy while learning data from distributed clients; (2) graph neural network (GNN) can extract structural properties of molecules whose underlying architecture is the connected atoms; and (3) generative adversarial network (GAN) can generate novel molecules while retaining the properties learned from the training data. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a holistic collaborative and privacy-preserving FL framework, namely FL-DISCO, which integrates GAN and GNN to generate molecular graphs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FL-DISCO on: (1) IID data for ESOL and QM9, where FL-DISCO can generate highly novel compounds with high drug-likeliness, uniqueness and LogP scores compared to the baseline; (2) non-IID data for ESOL and QM9, where FL-DISCO generates 100% novel compounds with high validity and LogP scores compared to the baseline.

A recent breakthrough formulates the problem as a continuous optimization with a structural constraint that ensures acyclicity (Zheng et al., 2018). The authors apply the approach to the linear structural equation model (SEM) and the least-squares loss function that are statistically well justified but nevertheless limited. Motivated by the widespread success of deep learning that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear mappings, in this work we propose a deep generative model and apply a variant of the structural constraint to learn the DAG. At the heart of the generative model is a variational autoencoder parameterized by a novel graph neural network architecture, which we coin DAG-GNN. In addition to the richer capacity, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles discrete variables as well as vector-valued ones. We demonstrate that on synthetic data sets, the proposed method learns more accurate graphs for nonlinearly generated samples; and on benchmark data sets with discrete variables, the learned graphs are reasonably close to the global optima.

Finding a good layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.;"[Kwon, Oh-Hyun; Ma, Kwan-Liu] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA";;Kwon, OH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;"kw@ucdavis.edu; ma@cs.ucdavis.edu";86;14;16;2;11;JAN;2020;26;1;665;675;;10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934396;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934396;WOS:000506166100062;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is known that the performance of conventional supervised graph convolutional models is mediocre at classification tasks, when only a small fraction of the labeled nodes are given. Additionally, most existing graph neural network models often ignore the noise in graph generation and consider all the relations between objects as genuine ground-truth. Hence, the missing edges may not be considered, while other spurious edges are included. Addressing those challenges, we propose a Bayesian Graph Attention model which utilizes a generative model to randomly generate the observed graph. The method infers the joint posterior distribution of node labels and graph structure, by combining the Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Model with the Graph Attention Model. We adopt a variety of approximation methods to estimate the Bayesian posterior distribution of the missing labels. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on three graph-based deep learning benchmark data sets.

In contrast to all learning formulations in the area of discriminative pattern recognition, we propose a scalable generative optimization/algorithm theoretically proved to capture distributions at the nodes of a graph. Our model is able to generate samples from the probability densities learned at each node. This probabilistic data generation model, i.e., convolutional graph autoencoder (CGAE), is devised based on the localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions, deep learning, and the variational Bayesian inference. We apply the CGAE to a new problem, the spatio-temporal probabilistic solar irradiance prediction. Multiple solar radiation measurement sites in a wide area in northern states of the U.S. are modeled as an undirected graph. Using our proposed model, the distribution of future irradiance given historical radiation observations is estimated for every site/node.

In early traffic forecasting studies, time-series models were adopted to accommodate autocorrelations between traffic states. The incorporation of spatial correlations into the forecasting of traffic states, however, involved a computational burden. Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.;"[Yu, Byeonghyeop; Sohn, Keemin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Engn, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Lee, Yongjin] ETRI, KSB Convergence Res Dept, Daejeon, South Korea";;Sohn, K (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Dept Urban Engn, 84 Heukseok Ro, Seoul 156756, South Korea.;"yuruka@daum.net; solarone@etri.re.kr; kmsohn@cau.ac.kr";44;55;56;10;83;MAY;2020;114;;189;204;;10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.013;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2020.02.013;WOS:000528280900010;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, sequential probabilistic generative models have achieved impressive results because they can model data distributions. However, modeling the distribution of dynamic graphs is still extremely challenging. Existing methods usually ignore the mutual interference of stochastic states and determin -istic states. Besides, the assumption that latent variables follow Gaussian distributions is usually inappro-priate. To address these problems, we propose stochastic graph recurrent neural network (SGRNN), a sequential generative model for the representation learning over dynamic graphs. It separates stochastic states and deterministic states in the iterative process. To improve the flexibility of latent variables, we set the prior distribution and posterior distribution as semi-implicit distributions and propose DSI-SGRNN. In addition, to alleviate the KL-vanishing problem in SGRNN, a simple and interpretable structure is proposed based on the lower bound of KL-divergence. The proposed structure introduces a few extra parameters and can be implemented with a few lines of code modification.

Conventional conformation generation methods minimize hand-designed molecular force field energy functions that are often not well correlated with the true energy function of a molecule observed in nature. They generate geometrically diverse sets of conformations, some of which are very similar to the lowest-energy conformations and others of which are very different. In this paper, we propose a conditional deep generative graph neural network that learns an energy function by directly learning to generate molecular conformations that are energetically favorable and more likely to be observed experimentally in data-driven manner. On three large-scale datasets containing small molecules, we show that our method generates a set of conformations that on average is far more likely to be close to the corresponding reference conformations than are those obtained from conventional force field methods. Our method maintains geometrical diversity by generating conformations that are not too similar to each other, and is also computationally faster. We also show that our method can be used to provide initial coordinates for conventional force field methods. On one of the evaluated datasets we show that this combination allows us to combine the best of both methods, yielding generated conformations that are on average close to reference conformations with some very similar to reference conformations.;"[Mansimov, Elman; Cho, Kyunghyun] NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Comp Sci, 60 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Mahmood, Omar; Cho, Kyunghyun] NYU, Ctr Data Sci, 60 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Kang, Seokho] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Syst Management Engn, 2066 Seobu Ro, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Cho, Kyunghyun] Facebook AI Res, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Cho, Kyunghyun] Canadian Inst Adv Res, 661 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada";;"Cho, K (corresponding author), NYU, Courant Inst Math Sci, Dept Comp Sci, 60 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011 USA.;Cho, K (corresponding author), NYU, Ctr Data Sci, 60 5th Ave, New York, NY 10011 USA.;Cho, K (corresponding author), Facebook AI Res, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Cho, K (corresponding author), Canadian Inst Adv Res, 661 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1M1, Canada.";kyunghyun.cho@nyu.edu;29;18;18;4;18;DEC 31;2019;9;;;;20381;10.1038/s41598-019-56773-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56773-5;WOS:000508985300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, accurately forecasting the motion behavior in a dynamic scenario is challenging due to the complex cooperative interactions between moving agents. Graph Convolutional Neural Network has recently been employed to deal with the cooperative interactions between agents. Despite the promising performance of resulting trajectory prediction algorithms, many existing graph-based approaches model interactions with an undirected graph, where the strength of influence between agents is assumed to be symmetric. However, such an assumption often does not hold in reality. For example, in pedestrian or vehicle interaction modeling, the moving behavior of a pedestrian or vehicle is highly affected by the ones ahead, while the ones ahead usually pay less attention to the ones behind. To fully exploit the asymmetric attributes of the cooperative interactions in intelligent transportation systems, in this work, we present a directed graph convolutional neural network for multiple agents trajectory prediction. First, we propose three directed graph topologies, i.e., view graph, direction graph, and rate graph, by encoding different prior knowledge of a cooperative scenario, which endows the capability of our framework to effectively characterize the asymmetric influence between agents.

Accurate traffic forecasting can make for better traffic management and alleviate traffic problems, such as traffic congestion and traffic pollution. Graph data structure can well express the topology structure of traffic network, so graph model has more development space in the field of traffic prediction. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey for the graph neural network in the field of traffic prediction. First, the graph model framework was divided into four categories, namely graph convolution networks, graph attention networks, graph auto-encoders and graph generative networks.

GT-GAN consists of a graph translator equipped with innovative graph convolution and deconvolution layers to learn the translation mapping considering both global and local features. A new conditional graph discriminator is proposed to classify the target graphs by conditioning on source graphs while training. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets in the domain of cybernetworks, the Internet of Things, and neuroscience demonstrate that the proposed GT-GAN model significantly outperforms other baseline methods in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.

The design of new candidate molecules requires large amounts of time and money, and computational methods are being increasingly employed to cut these costs. Machine learning methods are ideal for the design of large amounts of potential new candidate molecules, which are naturally represented as graphs. Graph generation is being revolutionized by deep learning methods, and molecular generation is one of its most promising applications. In this paper, we introduce a sequential molecular graph generator based on a set of graph neural network modules, which we call MG(2)N(2). At each step, a node or a group of nodes is added to the graph, along with its connections. The modular architecture simplifies the training procedure, also allowing an independent retraining of a single module. Sequentiality and modularity make the generation process interpretable. The use of Graph Neural Networks maximizes the information in input at each generative step, which consists of the subgraph produced during the previous steps. Experiments of unconditional generation on the QM9 and Zinc datasets show that our model is capable of generalizing molecular patterns seen during the training phase, without overfitting. The results indicate that our method is competitive, and outperforms challenging baselines for unconditional generation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To date, the bulk of research activity has focused mainly on static graphs. However, most real-world networks are dynamic since their topology tends to change over time. Predicting the evolution of dynamic graphs is a task of high significance in the area of graph mining. Despite its practical importance, the task has not been explored in depth so far, mainly due to its challenging nature. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts the evolution of dynamic graphs. Specifically, we use a graph neural network along with a recurrent architecture to capture the temporal evolution patterns of dynamic graphs. Then, we employ a generative model which predicts the topology of the graph at the next time step and constructs a graph instance that corresponds to that topology. We evaluate the proposed model on several artificial datasets following common network evolving dynamics, as well as on real-world datasets.

Tag; Shen, Yanming";TFGAN: Traffic forecasting using generative adversarial network with multi-graph convolutional network;KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS;;English;Article;;;;"Traffic forecasting; Multivariate time series; Generative adversarial network; Graph convolution network";;Traffic forecasting constitutes a task of great importance in intelligent transport systems. Owing to the non-Euclidean structure of traffic data, the complicated spatial correlations, and the dynamic temporal dependencies, it is challenging to predict traffic accurately. Despite the fact that few prior studies have considered the interconnections between multiple traffic nodes at the same timestep, the majority of studies fail to capture the dependencies among multiple nodes at different timesteps. Furthermore, most existing work generates shallow graphs based solely on the distance between traffic nodes, which limits their representation competence and declines their power in capturing complex correlations. In particular, inspired by the recent breakthroughs in the generative adversarial network (GAN) and the power of the graph convolution network (GCN) in handling non-Euclidean data, this paper puts forward an adversarial multi-graph convolutional neural network model, named TFGAN, to address the abovementioned problems. We integrate the unsupervised model elasticity with the supervision provided by supervised training to help the GAN generator model generates accurate traffic predictions. To improve the representation and model the implicit correlations effectively, multiple GCNs are constructed within the generator based on various perspectives, such as similarity, correlation, and spatial distance. Meanwhile, GRU and self-attention are applied after each graph to capture the dynamic temporal dependencies across nodes. The comprehensive experiments on three different traffic variables (traffic flow, speed, and travel time) using six real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TFGAN outperforms the related state-of-the-art models and achieves significant results.

However, most of the existing generative models for graphs are not invariant to the chosen ordering, which might lead to an undesirable bias in the learned distribution. To address this difficulty, we propose a permutation invariant approach to modeling graphs, using the recent framework of score-based generative modeling. In particular, we design a permutation equivariant, multi-channel graph neural network to model the gradient of the data distribution at the input graph (a.k.a., the score function). This permutation equivariant model of gradients implicitly defines a permutation invariant distribution for graphs. We train this graph neural network with score matching and sample from it with annealed Langevin dynamics. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the capacity of this new architecture in learning discrete graph algorithms. For graph generation, we find that our learning approach achieves better or comparable results to existing models on benchmark datasets.;"[Niu, Chenhao] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Song, Yang; Song, Jiaming; Zhao, Shengjia; Grover, Aditya; Ermon, Stefano] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA";;Niu, CH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;;40;2;2;0;1;;2020;108;;4474;4483;;;;WOS:000559931302058;View Full Record in Web of Science

Often, this graph is not fully representative of the true relationship amongst nodes. In these settings, building a generative model conditioned on the observed graph allows to take the graph uncertainty into account. Various existing techniques either rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to preserve topological properties within the samples or are prohibitively expensive for larger graphs. In this work, we introduce the node copying model for constructing a distribution over graphs. Sampling of a random graph is carried out by replacing each node's neighbors by those of a randomly sampled similar node. The sampled graphs preserve key characteristics of the graph structure without explicitly targeting them. Additionally, sampling from this model is extremely simple and scales linearly with the nodes. We show the usefulness of the copying model in three tasks. First, in node classification, a Bayesian formulation based on node copying achieves higher accuracy in sparse data settings. Second, we employ our proposed model to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks on the graph topology.

Some GNN-based graph embedding methods, including variational graph autoencoder (VGAE), have been presented recently. However, existing VGAE-based methods typically focus on reconstructing the adjacent matrix, i.e. topological structure, instead of the node features matrix, this strategy makes graphical features difficult to be fully learned, which weakens and restricts the capacity of a generative network to learn higher-quality representations. To address the issue, we use a contrastive estimator on the representation mechanism, i.e. on the encoding process under the framework of VGAE. In particular, we maximize the mutual information (MI) between encoded latent representation and node attributes which acts as a regularizer forcing the encoder to select the most informative with respect to the node attributes. Additionally, we also solve another key question how to effectively estimate the mutual information by drawing samples from the joint and marginal, and explain why the maximization of MI can contribute to the encoder obtaining more node feature information. Ultimately, extensive experiments on three citation networks and four web-age networks show that our method outperforms contemporary popular algorithms (such as DGI) on node classifications and clustering tasks, and the best result is an 8.28% increase on node clustering task.;"[Li, Dongjie; Li, Dong; Lian, Guang] South China Univ Technol, Sch Software Engn, 382 Wai Huan East Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China";;Li, DJ (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Software Engn, 382 Wai Huan East Rd, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;"273902683@qq.com; cslidong@scut.edu.cn";43;0;0;4;4;JUL;2022;36;9;;;2252012;10.1142/S0218001422520127;http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218001422520127;WOS:000835907600006;View Full Record in Web of Science

These graphs often evolve over time. Learning effective representations preserving graph topology, as well as latent patterns in temporal dynamics, has drawn increasing interests. In this paper, we investigate the problem of dynamic graph embedding that maps a time series of graphs to a low dimensional feature space. However, most existing works in the field of dynamic representation learning either consider temporal evolution of low-order proximity or treat high-order proximity and temporal dynamics separately. It is challenging to learn one single embedding that can preserve the high-order proximity with long-term temporal dependencies. We propose a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based model, named DynGraphGAN, to learn robust feature representations. It consists of a generator and a discriminator trained in an adversarial process. The generator generates connections between nodes that are represented by a series of adjacency matrices. The discriminator integrates a graph convolutional network for high-order proximity and a convolutional neural network for temporal dependency to distinguish real samples from fake samples produced by the generator. With iterative boosting of the performance of the generator and discriminator, node embeddings are learned to present dynamic evolution over time. By jointly considering high-order proximity and temporal evolution, our model can preserve spatial structure with temporal dependency. DynGraphGAN is optimized on subgraphs produced by random walks to capture more complex structural and temporal patterns in the dynamic graphs. We also leverage sparsity and temporal smoothness properties to further improve the model efficiency.

Theoretical analyses and empirical studies have pushed forward the translation of discrete graph structures into distributed representation vectors, but seldom considered the reverse direction, i.e., generation of graphs from given related context spaces. Particularly, since graphs often become more meaningful when associated with semantic contexts (e.g., social networks of certain communities, gene networks of certain diseases), the ability to infer graph structures according to given semantic conditions could be of great value. While existing graph generative models only consider graph structures without semantic contexts, we formulate the novel problem of conditional structure generation, and propose a novel unified model of graph variational generative adversarial nets (CONDGEN) to handle the intrinsic challenges of flexible context-structure conditioning and permutation-invariant generation. Extensive experiments on two deliberately created benchmark datasets of real-world context-enriched networks demonstrate the supreme effectiveness and generalizability of CONDGEN.;"[Yang, Carl; Zhuang, Peiye; Shi, Wenhan; Luu, Alan; Li, Pan] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";;Yang, C (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;"jiyang3@illinois.edu; peiye@illinois.edu; wenhans2@illinois.edu; alanluu2@illinois.edu; panli2@illinois.edu";52;6;6;0;0;;2019;32;;;;;;;WOS:000534424301034;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent literature has shown the effectiveness of machine learning models on travel time forecasting problems. However, most of these models predict travel time in a point estimation manner, which is not suitable for real scenarios. Instead of a determined value, the travel time within a future time period is a distribution. Besides, they all use grid structure data to obtain the spatial dependency, which does not reflect the traffic network's actual topology. Hence, we propose GCGTTE to estimate the travel time in a distribution form with Graph Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We convert the data into a graph structure and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to build its spatial dependency. Furthermore, GCGTTE adopts GAN to approximate the real travel time distribution. We test the effectiveness of GCGTTE with other models on a real-world dataset. Thanks to the fine-grained spatial dependency modeling, GCGTTE outperforms the models that build models on a grid structure data significantly. Besides, we also compared the distribution approximation performance with DeepGTT, a Variational Inference-based model which had the state-of-the-art performance on travel time estimation. The result shows that GCGTTE outperforms DeepGTT on metrics and the distribution generated by GCGTTE is much closer to the original distribution.;"[Song, Xiaozhuang; Zhang, Chenhan; Yu, James J.

Due to the high acquisition cost and processing time of multimodal MRI, existing deep learning frameworks based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) focused on predicting the missing multi-modal medical images from a few existing modalities. While brain graphs help better understand how a particular disorder can change the connectional facets of the brain, synthesizing a target brain multigraph (i.e, multiple brain graphs) from a single source brain graph is strikingly lacking. Additionally, existing graph generation works mainly learn one model for each target domain which limits their scalability in jointly predicting multiple target domains. Besides, while they consider the global topological scale of a graph (i.e., graph connectivity structure), they overlook the local topology at the node scale (e.g., how central a node is in the graph). To address these limitations, we introduce topology-aware graph GAN architecture (topoGAN), which jointly predicts multiple brain graphs from a single brain graph while preserving the topological structure of each target graph. Its three key innovations are: (i) designing a novel graph adversarial auto-encoder for predicting multiple brain graphs from a single one, (ii) clus-tering the encoded source graphs in order to handle the mode collapse issue of GAN and proposing a cluster-specific decoder, (iii) introducing a topological loss to force the prediction of topologically sound tar-get brain graphs. The experimental results using five target domains demonstrated the outperformance of our method in brain multigraph prediction from a single graph in comparison with baseline approaches.

The competition between attack and defense methods also enhances the robustness of GNNs. In this competition, the development of adversarial training methods put forward higher requirement for the diversity of attack examples. By contrast, most attack methods with specific attack strategies are difficult to satisfy such a requirement. To address this problem, we propose GraphAttacker, a novel generic graph attack framework that can flexibly adjust the structures and the attack strategies according to the graph analysis tasks. GraphAttacker generates adversarial examples through alternate training on three key components: the multi-strategy attack generator (MAG), the similarity discriminator (SD), and the attack discriminator (AD), based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). Furthermore, we introduce a novel similarity modification rate (SMR) to conduct a stealthier attack considering the change of node similarity distribution. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphAttacker can achieve state-of-the-art attack performance on graph analysis tasks of node classification, graph classification, and link prediction, no miter the adversarial training is conducted or not.

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories.

While there are a lot of focus on GNN models, understanding the impact of node features and graph structure to GNN performance has received less attention. In this paper, we propose an explanation for the connection between features and structure: graphs can be constructed by connecting node features according to a latent function. While this hypothesis seems trivial, it has several important implications. First, it allows us to define graph families which we use to explain the transferability of GNN models. Second, it enables application of GNNs for featureless graphs by reconstructing node features from graph structure. Third, it predicts the existence of a latent function which can create graphs that when used with original features in a GNN outperform original graphs for a specific task. We propose a graph generative model to learn such function. Finally, our experiments confirm the hypothesis and these implications. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, most of the current advanced methods of graph nodes clustering adopt the strategy of separating graph embedding technology and clustering algorithm, and ignore the potential relationship between them. Therefore, we propose an innovative end to-end graph clustering framework with joint strategy to handle the complex problem in a non-Euclidean space. In terms of learning the graph embedding, we propose a new variational graph auto-encoder algorithm based on the Graph Convolution Network (GCN), which takes into account the boosting influence of joint generative model of graph structure and node attributes on the embedding output. On the basis of embedding representation, we implement a self-training mechanism through the construction of auxiliary distribution to further enhance the prediction of node categories, thereby realizing the unsupervised clustering mode. In addition, the loss contribution of each cluster is normalized to prevent large clusters from distorting the embedding space. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets validate our design and demonstrate that our algorithm has highly competitive in graph clustering over state-of-theart methods.

This is non-trivial because human motion is inherently multi-modal: given a history of human motion paths, there are many plausible ways by which people could move in the future. Additionally, people activities are often driven by goals, e.g. reaching particular locations or interacting with the environment. We address the aforementioned aspects by proposing a new recurrent generative model that considers both single agents' future goals and interactions between different agents. The model exploits a double attention-based graph neural network to collect information about the mutual influences among different agents and to integrate it with data about agents' possible future objectives.

We develop a recursive neural net (RvNN) based autoencoder to map a flat, unlabeled, arbitrary part layout to a compact code. The code effectively captures hierarchical structures of man-made 3D objects of varying structural complexities despite being fixed-dimensional: an associated decoder maps a code back to a full hierarchy. The learned bidirectional mapping is further tuned using an adversarial setup to yield a generative model of plausible structures, from which novel structures can be sampled. Finally, our structure synthesis framework is augmented by a second trained module that produces fine-grained part geometry, conditioned on global and local structural context, leading to a full generative pipeline for 3D shapes.

This approach first learns the conditional probability distribution of small molecules from a large dataset of pocket structures with supervised training, followed by the sampling of drug candidates from the trained model. Comprehensive benchmarking simulations show that using Pocket2Drug significantly improves the chances of finding molecules binding to target pockets compared to traditional drug selection procedures.

Specifically, we formulate the problem of providing explanations for the decisions of GNNs as a causal learning task. Then we train a causal explanation model equipped with a loss function based on Granger causality. Different from existing explainers for GNNs, Gem explains GNNs on graph-structured data from a causal perspective. It has better generalization ability as it has no requirements on the internal structure of the GNNs or prior knowledge on the graph learning tasks. In addition, Gem, once trained, can be used to explain the target GNN very quickly. Our theoretical analysis shows that several recent explainers fall into a unified framework of additive feature attribution methods. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that Gem achieves a relative increase of the explanation accuracy by up to 30% and speeds up the explanation process by up to 110 x as compared to its state-of-the-art alternatives.;"[Lin, Wanyu] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Wanyu; Lan, Hao; Li, Baochun] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada";;"Lin, WY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Lin, WY (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Toronto, ON, Canada.";wanylin@comp.polyu.edu.hk;27;2;2;0;0;;2021;139;;;;;;;WOS:000683104606064;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we provide a new method to overcome the overfitting issue of pLSI by using the amortized inference with word embedding as input, instead of the Dirichlet prior in LDA. For generative topic model, the large number of free latent variables is the root of overfitting. To reduce the number of parameters, the amortized inference replaces the inference of latent variable with a function which possesses the shared (amortized) learnable parameters. The number of the shared parameters is fixed and independent of the scale of the corpus. To overcome the limited application of amortized inference to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) data, a novel graph neural network, Graph Attention TOpic Network (GATON), is proposed to model the topic structure of non-i.i.d documents according to the following two observations. First, pLSI can be interpreted as stochastic block model (SBM) on a specific bi-partite graph. Second, graph attention network (GAT) can be explained as the semi-amortized inference of SBM, which relaxes the i.i.d data assumption of vanilla amortized inference. GATON provides a novel scheme, i.e. graph convolution operation based scheme, to integrate word similarity and word co-occurrence structure. Specifically, the bag-of-words document representation is modeled as a bi-partite graph topology. Meanwhile, word embedding, which captures the word similarity, is modeled as attribute of the word node and the term frequency vector is adopted as the attribute of the document node. Based on the weighted (attention) graph convolution operation, the word co-occurrence structure and word similarity patterns are seamlessly integrated for topic identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the effectiveness of GATON on topic identification not only benefits the document classification, but also significantly refines the input word embedding.;"[Yang, Liang; Wu, Fan; Gu, Junhua] Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Yang, Liang; Wang, Chuan; Cao, Xiaochun] Chinese Acad Sci, IIE, SKLOIS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jin, Di] Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuanfang] Beihang Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China";;Jin, D (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;"yangliang@vip.qq.com; wufanslient@outlook.com; jhgu@hebut.edu.cn; wangchuan@iie.ac.cn; caoxiaochun@iie.ac.cn; jindi@tju.edu.cn; andyguo@buaa.edu.cn";59;7;7;0;3;;2020;;;144;154;;10.1145/3366423.3380102;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380102;WOS:000626273300014;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a novel proof of concept workflow that enables machine learning (ML) to automatically classify three-dimensional (3D) prototypes with respect to formulating the most appropriate building/ground relationship. Here, ML, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), can ascertain the most appropriate relationship from a set of examples provided by trained architects. Moreover, the system classifies 3D prototypes of architectural precedent models based on a topological graph instead of 2D images. The system takes advantage of two primary technologies. The first is a software library that enhances the representation of 3D models through non-manifold topology (Topologic). The second is an end-to-end deep graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN). The experimental workflow in this paper consists of two stages. First, a generative simulation system for a 3D prototype of architectural precedents created a large synthetic database of building/ground relationships with numerous topological variations. This geometrical model then underwent conversion into semantically rich topological dual graphs. Second, the prototype architectural graphs were imported to the DGCNN model for graph classification. While using a unique data set prevents direct comparison, our experiments have shown that the proposed workflow achieves highly accurate results that align with DGCNN's performance on benchmark graphs.

This setting makes it possible to learn concepts of communities from data without any prior knowledge. We propose the Seed Expansion with generative Adversarial Learning (SEAL), a framework for learning heuristics for community detection. SEAL contains a generative adversarial network, where the discriminator predicts whether a community is real or fake, and the generator generates communities that cheat the discriminator by implicitly fitting characteristics of real ones. The generator is a graph neural network specialized in sequential decision processes and gets trained by policy gradient. Moreover, a locator is proposed to avoid well-known free-rider effects by forming a dual learning task with the generator. Last but not least, a seed selector is utilized to provide promising seeds to the generator.

However, the validity of the ensemble result is usually affected by unreliability in the generation and integration of base clusterings. In order to address this issue, we develop a clustering ensemble framework viewed from graph neural networks that generates an ensemble result by integrating data characteristics and structure information. In this framework, we extract structure information from base clustering results of the data set by using a coupling affinity measure After that, we combine structure information with data characteristics by using a graph neural network (GNN) to learn their joint embeddings in latent space. Then, we employ a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to predict the final cluster assignment in the latent space. Finally, we construct the GNN and GMM as a unified optimization model to integrate the objectives of graph embedding and consensus clustering. Our framework can not only elegantly combine information in feature space and structure space, but can also achieve suitable representations for final cluster partitioning. Thus, it can produce an outstanding result. Experimental results on six synthetic benchmark data sets and six real world data sets show that the proposed framework yields a better performance compared to 12 reference algorithms that are developed based on either clustering ensemble architecture or a deep clustering strategy.;"[Du, Hang-Yuan; Wang, Wen-Jian] Shanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China";;Du, HY (corresponding author), Shanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China.;"duhangyuan@sxu.edu.cm; wjwang@sxu.edu.cn";45;1;1;2;2;JUN;2022;10;11;;;1834;10.3390/math10111834;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math10111834;WOS:000809467800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Both SC and FC are networks where the nodes are brain regions, and in SC, the edges are the physical fiber nerves among the nodes, while in FC, the edges are the nodes' coactivation relations. Despite the importance of SC and FC, until very recently, the rapidly growing research body on this topic has generally focused on either linear models or computational models that rely heavily on heuristics and simple assumptions regarding the mapping between FC and SC. However, the relationship between FC and SC is actually highly nonlinear and complex and contains considerable randomness; additional factors, such as the subject's age and health, can also significantly impact the SC-FC relationship and hence cannot be ignored. To address these challenges, here, we develop a novel SC-to-FC generative adversarial network (SF-GAN) framework for mapping SC to FC, along with additional metafeatures based on a newly proposed graph neural network-based generative model that is capable of learning the stochasticity. Specifically, a new graph-based conditional generative adversarial nets model is proposed, where edge convolution layers are leveraged to encode the graph patterns in the SC in the form of a graph representation. New edge deconvolution layers are then utilized to decode the representation back to FC. Additional metafeatures of subjects' profile information are integrated into the graph representation with newly designed sparse-regularized layers that can automatically select features that impact FC. Finally, we have also proposed new post hoc explainer of our SF-GAN, which can identify which subgraphs in SC strongly influence which subgraphs in FC by a new multilevel edge-correlation-guided graph clustering problem.

It has been proven effective in network analysis and mining tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Learning method based on neural network has become mainstream solution because it can efficiently preserve nonlinear characteristics of graph. However, more efficient ways to encode complex graph structures are still being explored. In this paper, for undirected graphs, we present a novel Motif-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (MotifGAN) model to learn graph representation based on a re-weighted graph, which unifies both the Motif higher order structure and the original lower order structure. Firstly, we obtain the motif adjacency matrix by motif mining, which encodes the Motif higher order structure. Then we couple the motif adjacency matrix with the adjacency matrix of the original graph to get a reweighted matrix named motif connectivity matrix. The motif connectivity distribution implicit in the motif connectivity matrix is the target structure information we need to preserve. How to preserve a wealth of structural information is a challenge. Inspired by related applications of GAN, we formulate a GAN model to generate embedding representations that satisfy the target structure conditions. The GAN model usually consists of two components: generator and discriminator. Our generator tries to approximate the motif connectivity distribution, while the discriminator detects whether the connectivity of two vertexes is from ground truth or generated by the generator. In adversarial training, both parts can alternately and iteratively boost their performance.

However, the applications derived from these raw graphs (eg, association predictions among genes, drugs, and diseases) have a high probability of false-positive predictions as co-occurrences in the literature do not always mean there is a true biomedical association between two entities. Objective: Data quality plays an important role in training deep neural network models; however, most of the current work in this area has been focused on improving a model's performance with the assumption that the preprocessed data are clean. Here, we studied how to remove noise from raw knowledge graphs with limited labeled information. Methods: The proposed framework used generative-based deep neural networks to generate a graph that can distinguish the unknown associations in the raw training graph. Two generative adversarial network models, NetGAN and Cross-Entropy Low-rank Logits (CELL), were adopted for the edge classification (ie, link prediction), leveraging unlabeled link information based on a real knowledge graph built from LitCovid and Pubtator. Results: The performance of link prediction, especially in the extreme case of training data versus test data at a ratio of 1:9, demonstrated that the proposed method still achieved favorable results (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >0.8 for the synthetic data set and 0.7 for the real data set), despite the limited amount of testing data available. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings showed the proposed framework achieved promising results for removing noise during data preprocessing of the biomedical knowledge graph, potentially improving the performance of downstream applications by providing cleaner data.";"[Jiang, Chao; Chapman, Richard] Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Auburn, AL USA; [Ngo, Victoria] VA Palo Alto Hlth Care Syst, Ctr Innovat Implementat, Sacramento, CA USA; [Ngo, Victoria] Stanford Univ, Stanford Sch Med, Stanford Hlth Policy, Stanford, CA USA; [Ngo, Victoria] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA USA; [Yu, Yue; Liu, Hongfang; Jiang, Guoqian; Zong, Nansu] Mayo Clin, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Informat Res, Rochester, MN USA; [Zong, Nansu] Mayo Clin, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Informat Res, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA";;Zong, NS (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Artificial Intelligence & Informat Res, 200 First St SW, Rochester, MN 55905 USA.;Zong.Nansu@mayo.edu;36;0;0;0;0;Jul 05;2022;24;7;;;e38584;10.2196/38584;http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/38584;WOS:000828200900011;View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional traffic prediction models are mostly statistic based methods, and they cannot effectively capture the nonlinear, stochastic and time-varying characteristics of the urban transportation systems. Another limitation of these methods is that they usually focus on analyzing one or several roads or road segments, but are not capable to predict the traffic conditions of all the road segments in a large transportation network of a city as a whole. Therefore, in recent years, deep neural network based methods for forecasting the road network-scale traffic have been emphasized greatly. However, most existing deep neural network methods model the traffic data of a road network as images rather than graphs, and thus they suffer from the blurry prediction issue and do not perform well on the task of multi-step traffic prediction. In this paper, We propose a network-scale deep traffic prediction model called GCGAN by combining adversarial training and graph CNN. Specifically, we propose a Generative Adversarial Net based prediction framework to address the blurry prediction issue by introducing the adversarial training loss. To predict the traffic conditions in multiple future time intervals simultaneously, we design a sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) based encoder-decoder model as the generator of GCGAN. To fully capture the spatial correlations among the road segments of a transportation network, we propose to apply a graph convolution network (GCN) in both generator and discriminator of GCGAN for feature learning. We evaluate our proposal over a large real traffic dataset in the arterial road network of downtown Chicago. The results show that GCGAN significantly outperforms both traditional statistic based methods and recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods.;"[Zhang, Yuxuan; Chen, Bing] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Senzhang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Senzhang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jiannong] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";;Zhang, YX (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;"zhangyuxuannuaa@163.com; szwang@nuaa.edu.cn; cb_china@nuaa.edu.cn; jiannong.cao@polyu.edu.hk";37;15;15;0;0;;2019;;;;;;;;WOS:000530893804015;View Full Record in Web of Science

The task is challenging due to the sparse and discrete nature of graph spaces. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature, most of which require to transform the graphs into sequences that encode their structure and labels and to learn the distribution of such sequences through an auto-regressive generative model. Among this family of approaches, we focus on the GRAPHGEN model. The preprocessing phase of GRAPHGEN transforms graphs into unique edge sequences called Depth-First Search (DFS) codes, such that two isomorphic graphs are assigned the same DFS code. Each element of a DFS code is associated with a graph edge: specifically, it is a quintuple comprising one node identifier for each of the two endpoints, their node labels, and the edge label. GRAPHGEN learns to generate such sequences auto-regressively and models the probability of each component of the quintuple independently. While effective, the independence assumption made by the model is too loose to capture the complex label dependencies of real-world graphs precisely. By introducing a novel graph preprocessing approach, we are able to process the labeling information of both nodes and edges jointly. The corresponding model, which we term GRAPHGEN-REDUX, improves upon the generative performances of GRAPHGEN in a wide range of datasets of chemical and social graphs. In addition, it uses approximately 78% fewer parameters than the vanilla variant and requires 50% fewer epochs of training on average.;"[Bacciu, Davide; Podda, Marco] Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3, Pisa, Italy";;Bacciu, D (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Comp Sci, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3, Pisa, Italy.;"davide.bacciu@unipi.it; marco.podda@di.unipi.it";37;0;0;1;1;;2021;;;;;;10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533743;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533743;WOS:000722581703076;View Full Record in Web of Science

How to perform a task of graph clustering, with a relatively high-quality optimization decision and an effective yet efficient way to use graph information, to obtain a more excellent assignment for discrete points is not an ordinary challenge that troubles scholars. Often, many preeminent works on graph clustering neglect an essential element that the defined clustering loss may destroy the feature space. This is also a vital factor that leads to unrepresentative nonsense features that generate poor partitioning decisions. Here, we propose an end-to-end variational graph clustering (EVGC) algorithm focusing on preserving the original information of the graph. Specifically, the KL loss with an auxiliary distribution serves as a specific guide to manipulate the embedding space, and consequently disperse data points. A graph auto-encoder plays a propulsive role in maximumly retaining the local structure of the generative distribution of the graph. And each node is represented as a Gaussian distribution in dealing with separating the true embedding position and uncertainty from the graph. Experimental results reveal the importance of preserving local structure, and our EVGC system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.;"[Guo, Lin; Dai, Qun] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China";;Dai, Q (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.;daiqun@nuaa.edu.cn;34;0;0;3;5;MAR;2022;34;5;3767;3782;;10.1007/s00521-021-06639-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06639-7;WOS:000711796400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The data describing these phenomena are multidimensional asynchronous event data that affect each other and show complex dynamic patterns in the continuous-time domain. The study of these dynamic processes and the mining of their potential correlations provide a foundation for the application of event propagation forecasting. However, conventional forecasting methods often make strong assumptions about the generative processes of the event data that may or may not reflect the reality, and the strong parametric assumptions also restrict the expressive power of the respective processes. Therefore, it is difficult to capture both the temporal and spatial effects of past event sequences. Most of the existing methods capture the intensity function of the Hawkes processes conditioned only on the historical events while ignoring the spatial information and the influences among different events. In this work, we propose the Astrologer, a graph neural Hawkes process that can capture the propagation of events from historical events on graph. The underlying idea of Astrologer is to incorporate the conditional intensity function of the Hawkes processes with a graph convolutional recurrent neural network. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that, Astrologer can learn the dynamics of event propagation without knowing the actual parametric forms. Astrologer can also learn the dynamics and achieve better predictive performance than other parametric alternatives based on particular prior assumptions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The molecules found by the GB-GA bear little resemblance to the molecules used to construct the initial mating pool, indicating that the GB-GA approach can traverse a relatively large distance in chemical space using relatively few (50) generations. The paper also introduces a new non-ML graph-based generative model (GB-GM) that can be parameterized using very small data sets and combined with a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm. The results are comparable to previously published results (Sci. Technol. Adv.

In contrast to the conventional node classification on graphs with all nodes being observable, it is more challenging to classify the hidden nodes that are unobservable during the training process, also known as the inductive learning in previous research. Existing approaches for inductive node classification mainly adopt graph neural network models to learn node representations. Although these methods are advantageous to modeling the topology of graph-structured data, they rely heavily on node features which may vary significantly in different specific application scenarios. In addition, the inherently changeable graph structure induced by hidden nodes may cause the over-fitting problem. To address the above issues and boost the performances of hidden node classification, we propose a deep generative model based on variational auto-encoders. Specifically, we design a novel graph neural network to aggregate the multi-hop neighbor information of each node. Meanwhile, to better utilize the graph structure information as a supplement to node features, we consider the heterogeneous node influences and introduce a gated attention mechanism using node degrees. Moreover, our proposed model can be trained by minibatches and thus is applicable to large social networks.

Consider the setting where we are restricted to only using the samples from a trained GAN for downstream group difference analysis (and do not have direct access to the real data). Will we obtain similar conclusions? In this work, we explore if generated data, i.e., sampled from such GANs can be used for performing statistical group difference tests in cases versus controls studies, common across many scientific disciplines. We provide a detailed analysis describing regimes where this may be feasible. We complement the technical results with an empirical study focused on the analysis of cortical thickness on brain mesh surfaces in an Alzheimer's disease dataset. To exploit the geometric nature of the data, we use simple ideas from spectral graph theory to show how adjustments to existing GANs can yield improvements. We also give a generalization error bound by extending recent results on Neural Network Distance.

Our experiments on common ODQA benchmark datasets (Natural Questions and TriviaQA) demonstrate that KG-FiD can achieve comparable or better performance in answer prediction than FiD, with less than 40% of the computation cost.;"[Yu, Donghan; Yang, Yiming] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Zhu, Chenguang; Fang, Yuwei; Wang, Shuohang; Xu, Yichong; Zeng, Michael] Microsoft Cognit Serv Res Grp, Redmond, WA USA; [Yu, Wenhao] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Ren, Xiang] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA";;Yu, DH (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.;"dyu2@cs.cmu.edu; chezhu@microsoft.com";40;0;0;0;0;;2022;;;4961;4974;;;;WOS:000828702305005;View Full Record in Web of Science

When presented with relational data, such as various forms of graphs, the logic program interpreter dynamically unfolds differentiable computation graphs to be used for the program parameter optimization by standard means. Following from the declarative, relational logic-based encoding, this results into a unified representation of a wide range of neural models in the form of compact and elegant learning programs, in contrast to the existing procedural approaches operating directly on the computational graph level. We illustrate how this idea can be used for a concise encoding of existing advanced neural architectures, with the main focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Importantly, using the framework, we also show how the contemporary GNN models can be easily extended towards higher expressiveness in various ways. In the experiments, we demonstrate correctness and computation efficiency through comparison against specialized GNN frameworks, while shedding some light on the learning performance of the existing GNN models.;"[Sourek, Gustav; Zelezny, Filip; Kuzelka, Ondrej] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Prague, Czech Republic";;Sourek, G (corresponding author), Czech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Dept Comp Sci, Prague, Czech Republic.;souregus@fel.cvut.cz;122;1;1;1;7;JUL;2021;110;7;1695;1738;;10.1007/s10994-021-06017-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06017-3;WOS:000661770500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of previous works have neglected the implicit variation patterns of traffic volume, failing to model its spatiotemporal dependencies comprehensively. Although graph convolutional networks have been widely applied to traffic volume forecasting, most are constructed using simple graphs with limited representations, which may restrict their ability to extract deep spatial features. Therefore, a novel deep learning model is proposed in this study to address these deficiencies for improving the forecasting accuracy of traffic volume. First, a new spatiotemporal dependencies generative adversarial network is proposed to generate synthetic data (i.e., synthetic traffic volume) by using traffic speed and occupancy to construct latent variables (i.e., the input of generator in generative adversarial network), which is beneficial for capturing the implicit variation patterns of traffic volume. Then, a new multi-graph convolutional network is proposed to explore and model the heterogeneous correlations among sensors from multiple perspectives, so as to facilitate the effective extraction of deep non-Euclidean spatial features. Finally, experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model makes accurate traffic volume forecasting and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.;"[Zhu, Kun; Zhang, Shuai; Hu, Zeqian] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Artificial Intelligence, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiusheng] China Jiliang Univ, Ctr THz Res, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Di] Zhejiang Univ Technol Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310051, Peoples R China; [Dai, Hua] Zhejiang Acad Transportat Sci, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China";;Zhang, S (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Artificial Intelligence, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.;"zhukun@zufe.edu.cn; zhangshuai@zufe.edu.cn; lijsh@cjlu.edu.cn; zhoudi@uniview.com; daihua@zjjtkyy.com; huzeqian@zufe.edu.cn";56;1;1;8;38;JAN;2022;187;;;;115992;10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115992;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115992;WOS:000705567600008;View Full Record in Web of Science

While most of current work attempts to regress parameters of human body model such as Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL) and Hand Model with Articulated and Non-rigid Deformations (MANO), these parametric approaches underperform compared to non-parametric approaches. Due to the lack of the spatial relationship in the input image, the parametric approaches are hardly used to reconstruct the human body precisely. Besides, the rotation parameter regression is a complex task in parametric approaches. Therefore, we introduce a novel graph convolutional neural network (Graph CNN)-based framework for estimating a non-parametric mesh model. Our key innovation is that the proposed model is trained in a generative adversarial manner. Firstly, Graph CNN utilizes mesh topology to capture integral information of the full 3D human shape and then generate a more smooth and high-quality human mesh model. Secondly, the discriminator in our network acts as a supervisor to specify whether a human shape and pose are real or not. The generator is encouraged to generate human body mesh that is close to the manifold of the real human mesh distribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. In contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, our method can achieve better performance in human shape and pose estimation.;"[Huang, Yuancheng; Xiao, Nanfeng] South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China";;Huang, YC (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.;yuancheng.huang@outlook.com;42;0;0;2;4;;2020;8;;215419;215425;;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3041926;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3041926;WOS:000597198200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Different from these conventional methods, we pretrain a generative neural network by stacking convolutional autoencoders to learn the latent data representation and then construct an affinity graph with them as a prior. Based on the pretrained model and the constructed graph, we add a self-expressive layer to complete the generative model and then fine-tune it with a new loss function, including the reconstruction loss and a deliberately defined locality-preserving loss. The locality-preserving loss designed by the constructed affinity graph serves as prior to preserve the local structure during the fine-tuning stage, which in turn improves the quality of feature representation effectively. Furthermore, the self-expressive layer between the encoder and the decoder is based on the assumption that each latent feature is a linear combination of other latent features, so the weighted combination coefficients of the self-expressive layer are used to construct a new refined affinity graph for representing the data structure. We conduct experiments on four datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the representation ability of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.

However, these analyses have limitations for inter-subject or between-group comparisons in which network sizes and edge densities may differ, such as in studies on neurodevelopment or brain diseases. Furthermore, descriptive neural network analyses lack an appropriate generic null model and a unifying framework. These issues may be solved with an alternative framework based on a Bayesian generative modeling approach, i.e. Bayesian exponential random graph modeling (ERGM), which explains an observed network by the joint contribution of local network structures or features (for which we chose neurobiologically meaningful constructs such as connectedness, local clustering or global efficiency). We aimed to identify how these local network structures (or features) are evolving across the life-span, and how sensitive these features are to random and targeted lesions. To that aim we applied Bayesian exponential random graph modeling on structural networks derived from whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging-based tractography of 382 healthy adult subjects (age range: 20.2-86.2 years), with and without lesion simulations. Networks were successfully generated from four local network structures that resulted in excellent goodness-of-fit, i.e. measures of connectedness, local clustering, global efficiency and intrahemispheric connectivity. We found that local structures (i.e. connectedness, local clustering and global efficiency), which give rise to the global network topology, were stable even after lesion simulations across the lifespan, in contrast to overall descriptive network changes - e.g. lower network density and higher clustering - during aging, and despite clear effects of hub damage on network topologies. Our study demonstrates the potential of Bayesian generative modeling to characterize the underlying network structures that drive the brain's global network topology at different developmental stages and/or under pathological conditions.

But the hyperspectral remote sensing image (HSI) has some problems, such as data redundancy, noise, lack of labeled samples, and insufficient utilization of spatial information. These problems affect the accuracy of HSI classification using graph neural networks. To solve the aforementioned problems, this article proposes graph-based semisupervised learning with weighted features for HSI classification. The method proposed in this article first uses the stacked autoencoder network to extract features, which is used to remove the redundancy of HSI data. Then, the similarity attenuation coefficient is introduced to improve the original feature weighting scheme. In this way, the contribution difference of adjacent pixels to the center pixel is reflected. Finally, to obtain more generalized spectral features, a shallow feature extraction mechanism is added to the stacked autoencoder network.

Although the deep graph generative models have achieved considerable success in recent years, some problems still need to be addressed. First, some models learn only the structural information and cannot capture the semantic information. Second, many existing models cannot be applied to large-scale datasets owing to a complex training process and a large number of parameters to be learned. Third, most of the existing models require domain-specific rules to be set up, resulting in poor generalization. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a domain-agnostic model with hierarchical recurrent neural networks, named GHRNN, which learns the distribution of graph data for generating new graphs. First, we utilize the minimum depth-first-search code to convert a graph into a unique edge sequence that naturally generalizes to various graphs. Then, we adopt the edge-level recurrent neural network (RNN) module to learn the global structure of a graph and the element-level RNN module to obtain semantic information, such as node labels, edge labels, and the timestamp of nodes. The element-level RNN module with a fixed and small number of time steps in GHRNN can efficiently scale to large datasets. Finally, we generate a large number of graphs and evaluate the effectiveness of our model by using 11 different metrics on diverse datasets ranging from molecules to citation networks. Extensive experimental results indicate that GHRNN can capture complex dependencies and generate the most realistic and diverse graphs, in contrast to several state-of-the-art baselines.

The traditional method to reason over random variables is to perform inference in this graphical model. However, in many cases the generating process is only a poor approximation of the much more complex true data generating process, leading to suboptimal estimations. The subtleties of the generative process are however captured in the data itself and we can learn to infer, that is, learn a direct mapping from observations to explanatory latent variables. In this work we propose a hybrid model that combines graphical inference with a learned inverse model, which we structure as in a graph neural network, while the iterative algorithm as a whole is formulated as a recurrent neural network. By using cross-validation we can automatically balance the amount of work performed by graphical inference versus learned inference. We apply our ideas to the Kalman filter, a Gaussian hidden Markov model for time sequences, and show, among other things, that our model can estimate the trajectory of a noisy chaotic Lorenz Attractor much more accurately than either the learned or graphical inference run in isolation.;"[Satorras, Victor Garcia; Welling, Max] Univ Amsterdam, UvA Bosch Delta Lab, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Akata, Zeynep] Univ Tubingen, Cluster Excellence ML, Tubingen, Germany; [Akata, Zeynep] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands";;Satorras, VG (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, UvA Bosch Delta Lab, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;"v.garciasatorras@uva.nl; zeynep.akata@uni-tuebingen.de; m.welling@uva.nl";37;4;4;0;1;;2019;32;;;;;;;WOS:000535866905047;View Full Record in Web of Science

A recently introduced DIstributed SpatioTemporal graph Artificial Neural network Architecture (DISTANA) is used and enhanced to learn such processes, requiring fewer parameters and achieving significantly more accurate predictions compared to temporal convolutional neural networks and other related approaches. We show that DISTANA, when combined with a retrospective latent state inference principle called active tuning, can reliably derive location-respective hidden causal factors.

The current mainstream research focuses on how to achieve accurate prediction on one large dataset. However, whether the multi-agent trajectory prediction model can be trained with a sequence of datasets, i.e., continual learning settings, remains a question. Can the current prediction methods avoid catastrophic forgetting? Can we utilize the continual learning strategy in the multi-agent trajectory prediction application? Motivated by the generative replay methods in continual learning literature, we propose a multi-agent interaction behavior prediction framework with a graph-neural-network-based conditional generative memory system to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to study the continual learning problem in multi-agent interaction behavior prediction problems. We empirically show that several approaches in literature indeed suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and our approach succeeds in maintaining a low prediction error when datasets come in a sequential way.

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a promising candidate for such purpose thanks to their power in data representation inference, but its vanilla form and common variations cannot process feature relations. In this paper, inspired by recent advances in relational learning with graph neural networks, we propose the Self-Attention Graph Variational AutoEncoder (SAG-VAE) model which can simultaneously learn feature relations and data representations in an end-to-end manner. The SAG-VAE is trained by jointly inferring the posterior distribution of two types of latent variables, which respectively represent the data and the feature relations. The feature relations are represented as a graph structure, and the presence of each edge is determined by a Gumbel-Softmax distribution. The generative model is accordingly parameterized by a graph neural network with a special attention mechanism we introduced in the paper. Therefore, the SAG-VAE model can generate via graph convolution and be trained via backpropagation. Experiments based on graphs show that SAG-VAE is capable of approximately retrieving edges and links between vertices based entirely on feature observations. Furthermore, experiments on image data illustrate that the learned feature relations can provide the SAG-VAE robustness against perturbations in image reconstruction and sampling. The learned feature relations as graph adjacency matrices are observed to be structured, which provides intuitive interpretability of the models.;"[Wang, Chen; Deng, Chengyuan; Ivanov, Vladimir] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA";;Wang, C (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New Brunswick, NJ 08854 USA.;"chen.wang.cs@rutgers.edu; charles.deng@rutgers.edu; vladimir.ivanov@rutgers.edu";43;0;0;0;0;;2020;;;;;;;;WOS:000626021404060;View Full Record in Web of Science

While pre-trained convolutional neural networks can be fine-tuned for other applications, the lower levels are often affected by changes in rotation and scale, since the approach is purely appearance-based. However, hybrid approaches that take both shape and appearance into account have shown success in general computer vision, so in this work we propose a graph network architecture that captures shape and texture information. Our approach separates shape and texture within a graph neural network in a manner analogous to an active appearance model (AAM), offering potential robustness to shape and scale. To test the effectiveness of this approach, we perform a series of experiments in both unsupervised and supervised settings on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets. First, we perform experiments using unsupervised image data and node position reconstruction; we also perform a cross-database experiment. As part of this work, we introduce an extension to the spectral graph convolution approach GCN by automatically generating weights based on a local and global representation in an effort to make the convolutions more flexible and less application or data specific. We call this new approach Generative GCN (GenGCN). Second, we develop approaches to allow grouping and ungrouping of triangle nodes within the graph. Specifically, we propose a Similarity Matrix generation approach to correctly identify similar triangle nodes. We also introduce a variant of the DIFFPOOL approach that allows us to reverse the grouping process. We performed experiments on MNIST with respect to triangle node grouping and ungrouping.

In this work, we introduce DeepLigBuilder, a novel deep learning-based method for de novo drug design that generates 3D molecular structures in the binding sites of target proteins.

Then, we combined L-Net with Monte Carlo tree search to perform structure-based de novo drug design tasks. In the case study of inhibitor design for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, DeepLigBuilder suggested a list of drug-like compounds with novel chemical structures, high predicted affinity, and similar binding features to those of known inhibitors. The current version of L-Net was trained on drug-like compounds from ChEMBL, which could be easily extended to other molecular datasets with desired properties based on users' demands and applied in functional molecule generation.

Besides the convolutional autoencoder-like architecture that can only model the spatial information within the regular patch inputs, DGMSSU is able to alternatively choose graph convolutional networks or self-attention mechanism modules to handle the irregular but more flexible data-superpixel. Experimental results on a simulated dataset, as well as two well-known real hyperspectral images, show the superiority of our proposed approach in comparison with other state-of-the-art spatial-spectral unmixing methods.

The Indian buffet process was used to model the community assignment matrix Z, and an uncollapsed Gibbs sampler has been derived. However, as the community assignment matrix Z is a structured multi-variable parameter, how to summarize the posterior inference results and estimate the inference quality about Z, is still a considerable challenge in the literature. In this paper, a graph convolutional neural network based graph classifier was utilized to help to summarize the results and to estimate the inference quality about Z. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data and real data, and find that empirically, the traditional posterior summarization strategy is reliable.;"[Yu, Qianchen; Yu, Zhiwen; Wang, Zhu] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Yu, Qianchen; Yu, Zhiwen; Wang, Zhu] Shanxi Prov Key Lab Embedded Syst, Xian 710072, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaofeng] North Minzu Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongzhi] Jilin Univ, Coll Earth Explorat Sci & Technol, Changchun 130025, Peoples R China";;"Yu, QC (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.;Yu, QC (corresponding author), Shanxi Prov Key Lab Embedded Syst, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.";yucomputer@mail.nwpu.edu.cn;53;2;2;5;12;DEC;2020;14;6;;;146323;10.1007/s11704-020-9370-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-020-9370-z;WOS:000552064500002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called STG-DAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction involving heterogeneous agents. The system takes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction. The constraint not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. Moreover, the proposed prediction model can be easily adopted by multi-target tracking frameworks. The tracking accuracy proves to be improved by empirical results. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction and tracking accuracy.;"[Li, Jiachen; Ma, Hengbo; Zhang, Zhihao; Li, Jinning; Tomizuka, Masayoshi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA";;Li, JC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mech Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;"jiachen_ji@berkeley.edu; hengbo_ma@berkeley.edu; zhihaozhang@berkeley.edu; jinning_li@berkeley.edu; tomizuka@berkeley.edu";62;3;3;17;24;AUG;2022;23;8;10556;10569;;10.1109/TITS.2021.3094821;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2021.3094821;WOS:000732200700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, deep generative approaches addressing the challenge belong to two broad categories, differing in how molecules are represented. One approach encodes molecular graphs as strings of text, and learns their corresponding character-based language model. Another, more expressive, approach operates directly on the molecular graph. In this work, we address two limitations of the former: generation of invalid and duplicate molecules. To improve validity rates, we develop a language model for small molecular substructures called fragments, loosely inspired by the well-known paradigm of Fragment-Based Drug Design. In other words, we generate molecules fragment by fragment, instead of atom by atom. To improve uniqueness rates, we present a frequency-based masking strategy that helps generate molecules with infrequent fragments. We show experimentally that our model largely outperforms other language model-based competitors, reaching state-of-the-art performances typical of graph-based approaches. Moreover, generated molecules display molecular properties similar to those in the training sample, even in absence of explicit task-specific supervision.;"[Podda, Marco; Bacciu, Davide; Micheli, Alessio] Univ Pisa, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3, I-56127 Pisa, Italy";;Podda, M (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.;;31;14;14;1;11;;2020;108;;2240;2249;;;;WOS:000559931302075;View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, the network is trained to generate a spatial arrangement of closed, deformable mesh parts, which respects the global part structure of a shape collection, e.g., chairs, airplanes, etc. Our key observation is that while the overall structure of a 3D shape can be complex, the shape can usually be decomposed into a set of parts, each homeomorphic to a box, and the finer-scale geometry of the part can be recovered by deforming the box. The architecture of SDM-NET is that of a two-level variational autoencoder (VAE). At the part level, a PartVAE learns a deformable model of part geometries. At the structural level, we train a Structured Parts VAE (SP-VAE), which jointly learns the part structure of a shape collection and the part geometries, ensuring the coherence between global shape structure and surface details.

Most existing methods ignore the rich semantic information of text data and are unable to fully utilize the text data in common representation learning. Moreover, they only considered the correlation of the data with the same semantic label, but ignored the correlation between the data with different semantic label. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised cross-modal retrieval method, called Graph-based Semantic Alignment Network (GSAN), which learns common representation by aligning the features of different modalities with semantic embeddings of text data. Firstly, we design a Deep Supervised Semantic Encoding (DSSE) module to train the semantic projector and label predictor which can exploit the semantic embeddings and the predicted labels from unlabeled data of text modality. Then, GAN-based Bidirectional Fusion (GBF) module is designed to learn the mapping networks of two modalities (image and text). In order to make the mapping networks generate semantically discriminative and modality -invariant representations, we utilize the underlying semantic information exploited by DSSE to construct Graph-based Triplet Constraint (GTC) which can enforce feature embeddings from the semantically-matched (image and text) pairs to be more similar and push those mismatched ones away. By the benefit of fully using of semantic information, our approach can only use fewer label data and achieves the performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, since we only utilize the mapping networks trained in GBF module to generate common representations in referring stage, our approach is efficient and time saving in real world application.

Given these problems, we propose a method called BiKA (Bidirectional Knowledge-assisted embedding and Attention-based generation). The model uses a bidirectional graph convolutional neural network to establish dependencies between objects. In addition, it employs a bidirectional attention-based generative network to achieve the mutual transformation between modalities. Specifically, the knowledge graph is used for local matching to constrain the local expression of the modalities, in which the generative network is used for mutual transformation to constrain the global expression of the modalities. In addition, we also propose a new position relation embedding network to embed position relation information between objects.

We are interested in studying how DFC are associated with the low-dimensional structure of neural activities. Most existing LVMs are based on a point process and fail to model evolving relationships.

However, the problem of fine-grained tweet geolocation prediction is challenging since tweets are short and therefore may not contain any geo-indicative words or may contain ambiguous, noisy information. Existing solutions either yield an unsatisfactory accuracy in practical applications or make predictions that even experts struggle to interpret, failing to engender sufficient trust and actionability for real-world deployment. Our paper presents a tweet geolocation prediction framework, EDGE (Entity-Diffusion Gaussian Ensemble), which delivers predictions that are both accurate and highly interpretable without requiring any additional contextual information such as user profile and location history. In EDGE, we cast the geolocation problem as a neutral network optimization problem by learning probabilistic generative models. Compared with existing works, EDGE has two distinctive features: (1) the inference builds on mining the correlation between non geo-indicative entities and geo-indicative entities by diffusing their semantic embeddings over the constructed graph neural network (Entity Diffusion) and (2) each prediction result is represented as a Gaussian mixture instead of specific geographical coordinates (Gaussian Ensemble). Extensive experiments using real-world tweet datasets validate the superiority of EDGE over the state of the art in terms of all distance-based and POI-based metrics.;"[Hui, Bo; Ku, Wei-Shinn] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Chen, Haiquan] Calif State Univ Sacramento, Sacramento, CA 95819 USA; [Yan, Da] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL USA";;Hui, B (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.;"bohui@auburn.edu; haiquan.chen@csus.edu; yanda@uab.edu; weishinn@auburn.edu";41;2;2;2;3;;2021;;;1092;1103;;10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00099;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00099;WOS:000687830800092;View Full Record in Web of Science

Huge dimensionalities of neuroimaging data as well as omics data pose tremendous challenge for methods integrating multiple modalities. There are few existing solutions that can combine both multi-modal imaging and multi-omics datasets to derive neurological insights. We propose a deep neural network architecture that combines both structural and functional connectome data with multi-omics data for disease classification. A graph convolution layer is used to model functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data simultaneously to learn compact representations of the connectome. A separate set of graph convolution layers are then used to model multi-omics datasets, expressed in the form of population graphs, and combine them with latent representations of the connectome. An attention mechanism is used to fuse these outputs and provide insights on which omics data contributed most to the model's classification decision. We demonstrate our methods for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification by using datasets from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). PD has been shown to be associated with changes in the human connectome and it is also known to be influenced by genetic factors. We combine DTI and fMRI data with multi-omics data from RNA Expression, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), DNA Methylation and non-coding RNA experiments. A Matthew Correlation Coefficient of greater than 0.8 over many combinations of multi-modal imaging data and multi-omics data was achieved with our proposed architecture. To address the paucity of paired multi-modal imaging data and the problem of imbalanced data in the PPMI dataset, we compared the use of oversampling against using CycleGAN on structural and functional connectomes to generate missing imaging modalities. Furthermore, we performed ablation studies that offer insights into the importance of each imaging and omics modality for the prediction of PD. Analysis of the generated attention matrices revealed that DNA Methylation and SNP data were the most important omics modalities out of all the omics datasets considered.

In this paper, we present SOLI (Stacked auto-encoder for nOde cLusterIng), an information maximization approach for learning graph representations by leveraging maximal cliques. SOLI relies on aggregating useful representations by assigning clique-based weights to various edges in a neighborhood while maximizing mutual information.

We hypothesize that it is beneficial to unify both tasks under one framework in order to learn a shared feature representation of agent interaction. Furthermore, instead of performing tracking and prediction sequentially which can propagate errors from tracking to prediction, we propose a parallelized framework to mitigate the issue. Also, our parallel track-forecast framework incorporates two additional novel computational units. First, we use a feature interaction technique by introducing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the way in which agents interact with one another. The GNN is able to improve discriminative feature learning for MOT association and provide socially-aware contexts for trajectory prediction. Second, we use a diversity sampling function to improve the quality and diversity of our forecasted trajectories. The learned sampling function is trained to efficiently extract a variety of outcomes from a generative trajectory distribution and helps avoid the problem of generating duplicate trajectory samples. We evaluate on KITTI and nuScenes datasets showing that our method with socially-aware feature learning and diversity sampling achieves new state-of-the-art performance on 3D MOT and trajectory prediction.

In addition, the spatial-temporal relations are captured by stacking a graph convolutional network (GCN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention mechanism. A comprehensive computational experiment was carried out including comparing model prediction and computational performances with several state-of-the-art deep learning models. The proposed approach has been implemented and applied for predicting short-term link traffic speed in a large-scale urban road network in Hangzhou, China. The results suggest that it provides a scalable and effective traffic prediction solution for urban road networks.;"[Jin, Junchen] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Rong, Dingding; Ji, Qingyuan] Enjoyor Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310030, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tong] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Ji, Qingyuan] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Guo, Haifeng] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310013, Peoples R China; [Lv, Yisheng; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaoliang] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Architecture Engn, Sch Architecture & Bldg Environm, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Ma, Xiaoliang] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Ctr Digital Futures, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden";;Ji, QY (corresponding author), Enjoyor Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310030, Peoples R China.;qingyuan.ji@zju.edu.cn;38;3;3;22;29;;;;;;;;10.1109/TITS.2022.3148358;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3148358;WOS:000758733600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the input text alone is usually hard to provide enough information to generate the desired output. Previous work attempts to incorporate syntactic information into the generative models based on variational autoencoder(VAE). But these methods have difficulty in adequately modeling the tree structure of syntactic data. In this paper, we formulate the syntactic structure as a graph and introduce a syntax encoder based on graph neural network(GNN) to model the syntactic information of sentences. Based on the syntax encoder, we propose a novel syntax-enhanced variational autoencoder(SEVAE) with two variants. The variant SEVAEm merges sentence information and syntactic information into one latent space to enrich the fine-grained syntactic information of latent representations. And the variant SEVAE-s with two separate latent spaces allows the sentence decoder to dynamically attend to semantic and syntactic information from two latent variables. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our methods achieve significant and consistent improvements compared with previous work.;"[Yuan, Weijie; Ding, Linyi; Meng, Kui; Liu, Gongshen] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China";;Liu, GS (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;"mryuan0428@sjtu.edu.cn; d01d01d01@sjtu.edu.cn; mengkui@sjtu.edu.cn; lgshen@sjtu.edu.cn";36;0;0;0;0;;2021;;;;;;10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533865;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533865;WOS:000722581704071;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, rumor detection suffers from the problem of imbalanced data. Existing methods of text generation and imbalanced learning are insufficient in addressing this imbalance because they are not specialized in rumor tasks. We propose a knowledge graph-based rumor data augmentation method: Graph Embedding-based Rumor Data Augmentation (GERDA), which simulates the generation process of rumor from the perspective of knowledge. To model the generation process of false information, we introduce knowledge representation in the process of text generation. To better learn the graph structured rumor data, we propose a graph-based rumor text generative model G2S-AT-GAN, which uses an attention-based graph convolutional neural network and a generative adversarial network for rumor text generation. Experiments show that our method is able to generate high-quality rumors of diverse topics and the generated rumors can further address rumor data imbalance for better performance in rumor detection.

Inter-relatedness of different financial instrument, i.e. financial networks, are often of strong interest, especially in market analysis. Currently, the financial networks are mainly constructed using the minimum spanning tree method or the maximally filtered graph method. Here we study a set of general coupled stochastic differential equations with correlation coefficients rho(ij). The thresholded values of rho(ij) can be written as the entries in the adjacent matrix that represents the edges of a financial network. We use a simple generative adversarial network (GAN) method to recover the correlation coefficients. The discriminator of the GAN consists of a single layer artificial neural network. The dropout rate of the discriminator is set to 0.5 and using the sigmoid activation function. The generator of the GAN consists of two layers that have a fully connected perceptrons. The output layer uses an exponential linear unit activation function and the GAN encoder is a two-layer perceptron with ReLU activation function. The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss. The method is able to recover the given hand-crafted networks correctly. We also demonstrated the use of the GAN method to build a correlation network between currencies. The networks built are able to show progressive changes in the relationship between currencies over the years.;"[Goh, Yong Kheng] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ctr Math Sci, Bandar Sungai Long, Kajang, Malaysia; [Lai, An-Chow] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Bandar Sungai Long, Kajang, Malaysia";;Goh, YK (corresponding author), Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Ctr Math Sci, Bandar Sungai Long, Kajang, Malaysia.;"gohyk@utar.edu.my; laiac@utar.edu.my";15;0;0;0;0;;2019;2138;;;;30016;10.1063/1.5121053;http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.5121053;WOS:000600994500022;View Full Record in Web of Science

It exhibits the technology level of a country. Chemists used to find the candidate material according to property regression and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR). Traditional methods focus on finding new molecule from prior knowledge with trial and error experiments. They are time-consuming and low efficiency on screening molecules. The appearance of machine learning (ML) changes this embarrassing situation in two ways. One is accelerating the property prediction process to prevent wasting time on worse candidates. The other is inverse molecule design which expands the imagination of human. Lots of researches show promising results using different inverse design method such as, variational auto-encoder (VAE), generative adversarial networks (GAN), reinforcement learning (RL), and recurrent neural network (RNN). They introduce uncertainty from different level to generate new structure candidates. In any method, molecule descriptor has a great impact on the result. The descriptor converts the 3D structures in real world to a vector or a notation string to feed into all kinds of ML models. Large number of descriptors have been developed in cheminformatic, bioinformatic, quantum chemistry and natural language process (NLP). Some classical descriptors are Coulomb matrix (CM), smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP), weighted graph (WG), simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES). They show different advantages and solving problems from different aspects. CM has clear definition and good result on energy regression. SOAP is good at reflecting local environment features of an atom. However, they are easy to encode but hard to decode. That is a reason why people prefer WG and SMILES in the structure inverse design tasks. WG and SMILES express structure as a graph (an atom as a node and a bond as an edge) or string to apply massive mature GNN or NLP algorithm on them. Nowadays, most of the ML applications on chemistry and molecule science are focus on developing new model to regress properties. However, it is thought that there is still large improving space on inverse design methods and traditional descriptors. In this paper, WG and SMILES are briefly introduced firstly. Then, four generative models are presented, including VAE, GAN, RL and RNN. Further, the current progress and challenges of inverse design methods are summarized case by case. Finally, some of the author.s understanding and explorations are given out.

Many researchers have focused on the spatio-temporal correlations under fixed topology structure in traffic network to improve the traffic forecasting accuracy. Despite their advantages, the existing approaches are not completely discussed that the association relationship among traffic network nodes are not invariable under different traffic conditions. In this paper, a novel traffic forecasting framework is proposed by integrating the dynamic association of traffic nodes with the spatio-temporal deep learning model. To be specific, an adaptive subgraph reformulation algorithm is designed first based on the specific forecasting interval to reduce the interference of irrelevant spatio-temporal information. After that, by enhancing the attention mechanism with the generative decoder, a spatio-temporal deep learning model with only one forward operation is proposed to avoid the degradation of accuracy in the long-term prediction, in which the spatio-temporal information and the external factors (such as weather and holiday) are fused together to be as an input vector. Based on the reformulated subgraph constructed of traffic nodes with closer spatio-temporal correlation, experiments show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms other GNN (Graph Neural Network)-based state-of-the-art baselines for various forecasting intervals on a real-world dataset.;"[Han, Shi-Yuan; Sun, Qi-Wei; Zhao, Qiang; Han, Rui-Zhi; Chen, Yue-Hui] Univ Jinan, Shandong Prov Key Lab Network Based Intelligent C, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China";;Han, SY (corresponding author), Univ Jinan, Shandong Prov Key Lab Network Based Intelligent C, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China.;"ise_hansy@ujn.edu.cn; sunqwjimson@gmail.com; zq9701@gmail.com; ise_hanrz@ujn.edu.cn; yhchen@ujn.edu.cn";35;0;0;3;3;MAR;2022;11;6;;;861;10.3390/electronics11060861;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11060861;WOS:000775525700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The success of deep neural networks in supervised learning heavily relies on a large amount of labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data with target labels is often challenging due to various reasons such as cost of labeling and privacy issues, which challenges existing deep models. In spite of that, it is relatively easy to obtain data with inexact supervision, i.e., having labels/tags related to the target task. For example, social media platforms are overwhelmed with billions of posts and images with self-customized tags, which are not the exact labels for target classification tasks but are usually related to the target labels. It is promising to leverage these tags (inexact supervision) and their relations with target classes to generate labeled data to facilitate the downstream classification tasks. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, we study a novel problem of labeled data generation with inexact supervision. We propose a novel generative framework named as ADDES which can synthesize high-quality labeled data for target classification tasks by learning from data with inexact supervision and the relations between inexact supervision and target classes. Experimental results on image and text datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADDES for generating realistic labeled data from inexact supervision to facilitate the target classification task.;"[Dai, Enyan; Sun, Yiwei; Wang, Suhang] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shu, Kai] IIT, Chicago, IL 60616 USA";;Dai, EY (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;"emd5759@psu.edu; kshu@iit.edu; yus162@psu.edu; szw494@psu.edu";46;0;0;1;1;;2021;;;218;226;;10.1145/3447548.3467306;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3467306;WOS:000749556800022;View Full Record in Web of Science

Various models have been applied to this field to gain high-quality embedding vectors and got prodigious success, such as Matrix Factorization, Multilayer Perceptron, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Networks, Graph Convolutional Network, and so on. However, a very powerful model-Convolutional Neural Network, which plays a significant role in Digital Image Processing, Natural Language Processing, etc.-has not been widely used (except whole-graph embedding). CNN is thought inappropriate to embed nodes into vectors because traditional CNN can only work on grid-like data such as images while a graph generally has a irregular structure. And with the development of the embedding method, high-order proximities are gradually found playing a crucial role in exploring the network's underlying structure. However, many existing embedding methods can only preserve fixed-order proximities, limiting the scope of their application. In this paper, we try to explore a viable way to apply CNN on node-embedding task. We first build an image for each node that can flexibly preserve different order proximities and feed them into a variation of the Convolutional Neural Network, the Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE), to generate embedding vectors.

A latent embedded graph is defined as a topological structure constructed over a set of lower-dimensional embedding (latent space) of points in a high-dimensional dataset learnt by a generative model. Given two samples in the original dataset, the problem of interpolation can simply be re-formulated as traversing through this embedded graph along the minimal path. This deceptively simple method is based on the fundamental observation that a low-dimensional space induced by a given sample is typically non-Euclidean and in some cases may even represent a multi-manifold. Therefore, simply performing linear interpolation of the encoded data may not necessarily lead to plausible interpolation in the original space. Latent embedded graphs address this issue by capturing the topological structure within the spatial distribution of the data in the latent space, thereby allowing for approximate geodesic computations in a robust and effective manner. We demonstrate our approach through variational autoencoder (VAE) as the method for learning the latent space and generating the topological structure using k-nearest-neighbor graph. We then present a systematic study of our approach by applying it to 2D curves (superformulae), image (Fashion-MNIST), and voxel (ShapeNet) datasets. We further demonstrate that our approach performs better than the linear case in preserving geometric and topological variations during interpolation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Several attempts have tried to address this gap (i.e., Naive Bayes, RNN, LSTM, word embedding, etc.), even though the deep learning models achieved high performance, their generative process remains a black-box and not fully disclosed due to the high dimensional feature and the non-deterministic weights assignment. Meanwhile, graphs are becoming more popular when modeling complex systems while being traceable and understood. Here, we reveal that a good trade-off transparency and efficiency could be achieved with a Deep Neural Network by exploring the Credit Assignment Paths theory. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm which alleviates the features' extraction mechanism and attributes an importance level of selected neurons by applying a deterministic edge/node embeddings with attention scores on the input unit and backward path respectively. We experiment on the Twitter Health News dataset were the model has been extended to approach different approximations (tweet/aspect and tweets' source levels, frequency, polarity/subjectivity), it was also transparent and traceable. Moreover, results of comparing with four recent models on same data corpus for tweets analysis showed a rapid convergence with an overall accuracy of approximate to 83% and 94% of correctly identified true positive sentiments. Therefore, weights can be ideally assigned to specific active features by following the proposed method. As opposite to other compared works, the inferred features are conditioned through the users' preferences (i.e., frequency degree) and via the activation's derivatives (i.e., reject feature if not scored).

To bridge such gap, this article proposed a fuzzy detection system for rumors through explainable adaptive learning. Specifically, its core is a graph embedding-based generative adversarial network (Graph-GAN) model. First of all, it constructs fine-grained feature spaces via graph-level encoding. Furthermore, it introduces continuous adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator for unsupervised decoding. The two-stage scheme not only solves the fuzzy rumor detection under unsupervised scenarios, but also improves robustness of the unsupervised training. Empirically, a set of experiments are carried out based on three real-world datasets. Compared with seven benchmark methods in terms of four metrics, the results of the Graph-GAN reveal a proper performance, which averagely exceeds baselines by 5-10%.;"[Guo, Zhiwei] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Natl Res Base Intelligent Mfg Serv, Chongqing Engn Lab Detect Control & Integrated Sy, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China; [Yu, Keping] Waseda Univ, Global Informat & Telecommun Inst, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Jolfaei, Alireza] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2113, Australia; [Bashir, Ali Kashif] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp & Math, Manchester M15 6BH, Lancs, England; [Bashir, Ali Kashif] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci SEECS, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Bashir, Ali Kashif] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Almagrabi, Alaa Omran] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Syst, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Kumar, Neeraj] Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Neeraj] Asia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan; [Kumar, Neeraj] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sch Comp, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India";;Yu, KP (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Global Informat & Telecommun Inst, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.;"zwguo@ctbu.edu.cn; keping.yu@aoni.waseda.jp; alireza.jolfaei@mq.edu.au; Dr.alikashif.b@ieee.org; aalmagrabi3@kau.edu.sa; neeraj.kumar@thapar.edu";45;57;57;26;43;DEC;2021;29;12;3650;3664;;10.1109/TFUZZ.2021.3052109;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2021.3052109;WOS:000724479300010;View Full Record in Web of Science

The state-of-the-art NA methods learn inter-network node similarities based on labeled anchor links, which are costly, time-consuming, and difficult to acquire. Therefore, a few unsupervised network alignment (UNA) methods propose solving NA problems without anchor links. However, most existing UNA methods rely on discriminative attributes to capture nodes' similarities and are hard to obtain optimal one-to-one alignments. Toward these issues, this article proposes a novel method named HackGAN to solve the UNA problem solely based on the structural information. Specifically, HackGAN represents nodes with embeddings based on an unsupervised graph neural network (GNN) to capture their global and local structural features. After that, it initializes mapping functions to transform the embedding spaces of different networks into the same vector space by iteratively solving the Wasserstein-Procrustes problem. The mapping functions are then refined by an adversarial model with cycle-consistency and Sinkhorn distance losses to obtain optimized one-to-one mappings. Based on the distances between mapped embeddings, accurate and robust results are obtained with a collective alignment algorithm. Experimental comparisons on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HackGAN.;"[Yang, Linyao; Wang, Xiao; Xu, Yancai; Wang, Fei-Yue] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Yang, Linyao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao; Xu, Yancai; Hou, Jiachen; Wang, Fei-Yue] Qingdao Acad Intelligent Ind, Qingdao 266200, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jun; Yang, Jun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jiachen] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Taipa 999078, Macao, Peoples R China; [Xin, Kejun] Nanjing Joinmap Data Res Inst, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China";;Wang, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;"yanglinyao2017@ia.ac.cn; x.wang@ia.ac.cn; jun.zhang.ee@whu.edu.cn; jyang@whu.edu.cn; yancai.xu@ia.ac.cn; jiachen.hou@qaii.qc.cn; xinkj@joinmap.ai; feiyue.wang@ia.ac.cn";53;1;1;8;14;;;;;;;;10.1109/TCSS.2022.3144350;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCSS.2022.3144350;WOS:000751481300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The empirical results on three real-world datasets show that NAWAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, by over 13% of accuracy against unsupervised methods and on par or better than supervised methods.

However, the existing methods usually search architectures in a small-scale, well-designed architecture space, discover only one architecture in a single search, and hardly rework, which severely limits their potential. In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture generator (NAG) that can efficiently sample architectures in a large-scale architecture space. Like a generative adversarial network (GAN), our model consists of two components: (1) a generator that can generate directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as cells or blocks of neural architectures and (2) a discriminator that can estimate the probability that a DAG comes from cells of real architectures rather than the generator. Furthermore, we employ a random search with NAG (RS-NAG) to discover the optimal architecture according to the customized requirements. Experimental results show that the NAG can generate diverse architectures with our customized requirements multiple times after one adversary training. Furthermore, compared with the existing methods, our RS-NAG achieves the competitive results with 2.50% and 25.5% top-1 accuracies on two benchmark datasets - CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Photocatalytic water splitting using sunlight is perhaps the cleanest way of producing the hydrogen fuel. Among various other factors, widespread adoption of this technology has mainly been stymied by the lack of a catalyst material with high efficiency. 2D materials have shown significant promise as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The availability of open databases containing the computed properties of 2D materials and advancements in deep learning now enable us to do inverse design of these 2D photocatalysts for water splitting. We use one such database (Jain et al., ACS Energ. Lett. 2019, 4, 6, 1410-1411) to build a generative model for the discovery of novel 2D photocatalysts. The structures of the materials were converted into a 3D image-based representation that was used to train a cell, a basis autoencoder and a segmentation network to ascertain the lattice parameters as well as position of atoms from the images. Subsequently, the cell and basis encodings were used to train a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a continuous representation of the materials in a latent space. The latent space of the CVAE was then sampled to generate several new 2D materials that were likely to be efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. The bandgap of the generated materials was predicted using a graph neural network model while the band edge positions were obtained via empirical correlations. Although our generative modeling framework was used to discover novel 2D photocatalysts for water splitting reaction, it is generic in nature and can be used directly to discover novel materials for other applications as well.;"[Agarwal, Abhishek; Goverapet Srinivasan, Sriram; Rai, Beena] Tata Consulatncy Serv Ltd, TCS Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India";;Srinivasan, SG (corresponding author), Tata Consulatncy Serv Ltd, TCS Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India.;s.goverapet@tcs.com;63;1;1;4;15;Sep 16;2021;8;;;;679269;10.3389/fmats.2021.679269;http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmats.2021.679269;WOS:000702007400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Then, instead of directly learning the discriminative structure, it learns a generative graph, constructs its stochastic inverse, and then constructs a discriminative graph. We prove that conditional-dependency relations among the latent variables in the generative graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph.

The null operator permits evolution to select the number of active commands used, avoiding a problem with needing to tune a gene length parameter. The representation is parametrized by the probability of each command appearing in initial populations and during mutation. A parameter study leads to a number of rules of thumb for using the new representation and it is found that the number of failures to find a solution, in 3000 attempts, varies from 17 in 3000 as the parameters are changed.

Concretely, we infer the unobserved confounders existing in the user-item interactions with an inference network. Then we leverage a generative network to generate users' personalized intents that contain no unobserved confounders. In order to learn comprehensive users' intents, we model the user-user interactions by adopting state-of-the-art GNN with a new aggregating strategy.

Attribute inference aims to infer users' missing attribute labels based on observed data to make this valuable data usable for downstream tasks like user profiling and personalized recommendation. Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), an end-to-end deep generative model, has shown promising performance by handling the problem in a semi-supervised way. However, VAEs can easily suffer from over-fitting and over-smoothing when applied to attribute inference. Specifically, VAE implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can only reconstruct input data but fail to infer missing parts. While using the trending graph neural networks (GNNs) as encoder has the problem that GNNs aggregate redundant information from the neighborhood and generate indistinguishable user representations, known as over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose an attribute Inference model based on Adversarial VAE (Infer-AVAE) to cope with these issues. Specifically, to overcome over-smoothing, Infer-AVAE unifies MLP and GNNs in the encoder to learn positive and negative latent representations respectively. Meanwhile, an adversarial network is trained to distinguish the two representations, and GNNs are trained to aggregate less noise for more robust representations through adversarial training. Finally, to relieve over-fitting, mutual information constraint is introduced as a regularizer for the decoder to make better use of auxiliary information in representations and generate outputs not limited by observations. We evaluate our model on four real world social network datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our model averagely outperforms baselines by 7.0% in accuracy. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, our model exhibits strong generalization properties, as highlighted by its competitive link prediction performance, despite not being trained specifically for this task. Being the first approach to combine both of these desirable properties, NetGAN opens exciting avenues for further research.;"[Bojchevski, Aleksandar; Shchur, Oleksandr; Zugner, Daniel; Gunnemann, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany";;Zugner, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.;zuegnerd@in.tum.de;43;53;57;0;0;;2018;80;;;;;;;WOS:000683379200063;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper addresses the problem of generating well-grounded responses by integrating knowledge graphs into the dialogue system's response generation process, in an end-to-end manner. A dataset for non-goal oriented dialogues is proposed in this paper in the domain of soccer, conversing on different clubs and national teams along with a knowledge graph for each of these teams. A novel neural network architecture is also proposed as a baseline on this dataset, which can integrate knowledge graphs into the response generation process, producing well articulated, knowledge grounded responses.

This fact makes topological representation of maps very important in navigation and localization applications. When infrastructure-based systems (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi) are available, the problem is referred to as map-matching where the goal is to improve localization accuracy. On the other hand, localization becomes a problem in the lack of initialization for infrastructure-free systems (e.g., dead reckoning via odometry). For example, a pedestrian inertial navigation system (INS) can be used to generate drift-prone trajectories that would perfectly turn into graphs (consisting of nodes and edges) after heuristic corrections such as zero-velocity update (ZUPT), heuristic drift reduction (HDR) and motion direction aid by Earth's magnetic field. Most of the approaches use probabilistic generative methods to solve sub-graph traversal problem. This research adopts a neural network structure that is originally designed for language translation purposes and modifies it to achieve pedestrian localization on topological maps. Different feature combinations (angle vs. edge length) and number of traversed nodes are tested in the experiments. A minimum accuracy of 95% is achieved with all feature configurations while traversing only six nodes on the map.;"[Wei, Jianli; Koroglu, M.

In this work, the design of novel NFAs with required properties is performed with the conditional generative model constructed from a convolutional neural network (CNN). The temporal CNN is firstly trained to be a good string-based molecular conditional generative model to directly generate the desired molecules. The reliability of generated molecular properties is then demonstrated by a graph-based prediction model and evaluated with quantum chemical calculations. Specifically, the global attention mechanism is incorporated in the prediction model to pool the extracted information of molecular structures and provide interpretability. By combining the generative and prediction models, thousands of NFAs with required frontier molecular orbital energies are generated. The generated new molecules essentially explore the chemical space and enrich the database of transformation rules for molecular design. The conditional generation model can also be trained to generate the molecules from molecular fragments, and the contribution of molecular fragments to the properties is subsequently predicted by the prediction model.;"[Peng, Shi-Ping; Yang, Xin-Yu; Zhao, Yi] Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Fujian Prov Key Lab Theoret & Computat Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China";;Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Phys Chem Solid Surfaces, Fujian Prov Key Lab Theoret & Computat Chem, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.;"psphi@stu.xmu.edu.cn; 20520181152664@stu.xmu.edu.cn; yizhao@xmu.edu.cn";57;0;0;1;11;AUG;2021;22;16;;;9099;10.3390/ijms22169099;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms22169099;WOS:000690573600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Developing and evaluating practical SAT solvers relies on extensive empirical testing on a set of real-world benchmark for-mulas. However, the availability of such real-world SAT formulas is limited. While these benchmark formulas can be augmented with synthetically generated ones, existing approaches for doing so are heavily hand-crafted and fail to simultaneously capture a wide range of characteristics exhibited by real-world SAT instances. In this work, we present G2SAT, the first deep generative framework that learns to generate SAT formulas from a given set of input formulas. Our key insight is that SAT formulas can be transformed into latent bipartite graph representations which we model using a specialized deep generative neural network. We show that G2SAT can generate SAT formulas that closely resemble given real-world SAT instances, as measured by both graph metrics and SAT solver behavior. Further, we show that our synthetic SAT formulas could be used to improve SAT solver performance on real-world benchmarks, which opens up new opportunities for the continued development of SAT solvers and a deeper understanding of their performance.;"[You, Jiaxuan; Wu, Haoze; Barrett, Clark; Leskovec, Jure] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Ramanujan, Raghuram] Davidson Coll, Davidson, NC 28036 USA";;You, JX (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;"jiaxuan@cs.stanford.edu; haozewu@stanford.edu; barrett@cs.stanford.edu; raramanujan@davidson.edu; jure@cs.stanford.edu";45;0;0;0;1;;2019;32;;;;;;;WOS:000535866902021;View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, there have been many important data-driven ML applications for intrusion detection. Despite these great achievements, however, gathering a large amount of reliable data remains expensive and time-consuming, or even impossible. In this regard, FSL has been shown to have advantages in terms of processing small, abnormal data samples in the huge application space of intrusion detection. FSL can improve ML for scarce data at three levels: the data, the model, and the algorithm levels. Previous knowledge plays an important role in all three approaches. Many promising methods such as data enrichment, the graph neural network model, and multitask learning have also been developed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest research progress in the area of FSL. We first introduce the theoretical background to ML and FSL and then describe the general features, advantages, and main methods of FSL. FSL methods such as embedded learning, multitask learning, and generative models are applied to intrusion detection to improve the detection accuracy effectively. Then, the application of FSL to intrusion detection is reviewed in detail, including enriching the dataset by extracting intermediate features, using graph embedding and meta-learning methods to improve the model.

Here the authors investigate the application of chemical language models to challenging modeling tasks demonstrating their capability of learning complex molecular distributions. Deep generative models of molecules have grown immensely in popularity, trained on relevant datasets, these models are used to search through chemical space. The downstream utility of generative models for the inverse design of novel functional compounds, depends on their ability to learn a training distribution of molecules. The most simple example is a language model that takes the form of a recurrent neural network and generates molecules using a string representation. Since their initial use, subsequent work has shown that language models are very capable, in particular, recent research has demonstrated their utility in the low data regime. In this work, we investigate the capacity of simple language models to learn more complex distributions of molecules. For this purpose, we introduce several challenging generative modeling tasks by compiling larger, more complex distributions of molecules and we evaluate the ability of language models on each task. The results demonstrate that language models are powerful generative models, capable of adeptly learning complex molecular distributions. Language models can accurately generate: distributions of the highest scoring penalized LogP molecules in ZINC15, multi-modal molecular distributions as well as the largest molecules in PubChem.

Here, we introduce a generative neural network for 3d point sets that respects the rotational invariance of the targeted structures. We apply it to the generation of molecules and demonstrate its ability to approximate the distribution of equilibrium structures using spatial metrics as well as established measures from chemoinformatics. As our model is able to capture the complex relationship between 3d geometry and electronic properties, we bias the distribution of the generator towards molecules with a small HOMO-LUMO gap - an important property for the design of organic solar cells.;"[Gebauer, Niklas W.

To obtain a normal pattern, we made an assumption that the normal values should be temporally smooth and spatially similar. Then, the smoothness and similarity-inducing operations are used in the framework of the proposed model. Through the addition of smoothness and similarity losses in sequential variational autoencoder, the proposed model can obtain a temporally smooth and spatially similar pattern.

A natural idea to mitigate this problem is to bias these algorithms toward more easily synthesizable molecules using a proxy score for synthetic accessibility. However, using currently available proxies can still result in highly unrealistic compounds. Here, we propose a novel approach, RetroGNN, to estimate synthesizability. First, we search for routes using synthesis planning software for a large number of random molecules. This information is then used to train a graph neural network to predict the outcome of the synthesis planner given the target molecule, in which the regression task can be used as a synthesizability scorer. We highlight how RetroGNN can be used in generative molecule-discovery pipelines together with other scoring functions. We evaluate our approach on several QSAR-based molecule design benchmarks, for which we find synthesizable molecules with state-of-the-art scores. Compared to the virtual screening of S million existing molecules from the ZINC database, using RetroGNNScore with a simple fragment-based de novo design algorithm finds molecules predicted to be more likely to possess the desired activity exponentially faster, while maintaining good druglike properties and being easier to synthesize. Importantly, our deep neural network can successfully filter out hard to synthesize molecules while achieving a 10(5) times speedup over using retrosynthesis planning software.;"[Liu, Cheng-Hao; Korablyov, Maksym; Bengio, Yoshua] Mila, Montreal, PQ H2S 3H1, Canada; [Liu, Cheng-Hao; Korablyov, Maksym; Bengio, Yoshua] Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H2S 3H1, Canada; [Jastrzebski, Stanislaw; Wlodarczyk-Pruszynski, Pawel] Moleculeone, PL-00815 Warsaw, Poland; [Jastrzebski, Stanislaw] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Math & Comp Sci, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland; [Segler, Marwin] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Organ Chem, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Segler, Marwin] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Ctr Multiscale Theory & Computat, D-48149 Munster, Germany; [Segler, Marwin] Microsoft Res, Cambridge CB1 2FB, England";;"Liu, CH (corresponding author), Mila, Montreal, PQ H2S 3H1, Canada.;Liu, CH (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Montreal, PQ H2S 3H1, Canada.;Segler, M (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Organ Chem, D-48149 Munster, Germany.;Segler, M (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Ctr Multiscale Theory & Computat, D-48149 Munster, Germany.;Segler, M (corresponding author), Microsoft Res, Cambridge CB1 2FB, England.";"chenghao.liu@mail.mcgill.ca; marwinsegler@microsoft.com";46;0;0;6;6;MAY 23;2022;62;10;2293;2300;;10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01476;http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01476;WOS:000805762200005;View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the uncertainty of the prediction is also crucial. Most existing approaches however can only estimate uncertainty through repeated sampling of generative models. Additionally, most current predictive models are trained on datasets that assume complete observability of the crowd using an aerial view. These are generally not representative of real-world usage from a vehicle perspective, and can lead to the underestimation of uncertainty bounds when the on-board sensors are occluded. Inspired by prior work in motion prediction using spatio-temporal graphs, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN)-based approach, Attentional-GCNN, which aggregates information of implicit interaction between pedestrians in a crowd by assigning attention weight in edges of the graph. Our model can either output a probabilistic distribution or faster deterministic prediction, demonstrating applicability to autonomous vehicle use cases where either speed or accuracy with uncertainty bounds are required. To further improve the training of predictive models, we propose an automatically labelled pedestrian dataset collected from an intelligent vehicle platform representative of real-world use.

In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for reconstructing 3D tree models with high fidelity from a single image. The key to single image-based tree reconstruction is to recover 3D shape information of trees via a deep neural network learned from a set of synthetic tree models. We adopted a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to infer the 3D silhouette and skeleton of a tree respectively from edges extracted from the image and simple 2D strokes drawn by the user. Based on the predicted 3D silhouette and skeleton, a realistic tree model that inherits the tree shape in the input image can be generated using a procedural modeling tech-nique. Experiments on varieties of tree examples demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing realistic 3D tree models from a single image.;"[Liu, Zhihao; Wu, Kai; Deussen, Oliver; Cheng, Zhanglin] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhihao; Wu, Kai; Guo, Jianwei; Cheng, Zhanglin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jianwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, NLPR, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunhai] Shandong Univ, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Deussen, Oliver] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany";;"Cheng, ZL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Guo, JW; Cheng, ZL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Guo, JW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, NLPR, Beijing, Peoples R China.";"liuzh96@outlook.com; kai.wu@siat.ac.cn; jianwei.guo@nlpr.ia.ac.cn; cloudseawang@gmail.com; oliver.deussen@uni-konstanz.de; zl.cheng@siat.ac.cn";55;3;3;12;22;SEP;2021;117;;;;101115;10.1016/j.gmod.2021.101115;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gmod.2021.101115;WOS:000698640800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Generative networks such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks are trained to encode shapes into latent vectors, effectively learning a latent shape space that can be sampled for generating new shapes. Our main idea is to enable users to explore the shape space with the use of high-level semantic keywords. Specifically, the user inputs a set of keywords that describe the general attributes of the shape to be generated, e.g., four legs for a chair. Then, our method maps the keywords to a subspace of the latent space, where the subspace captures the shapes possessing the specified attributes. The user then explores only this subspace to search for shapes that satisfy the design goal, in a process similar to using a parametric shape model. Our exploratory approach allows users to model shapes at a high level without the need for advanced artistic skills, in contrast to existing methods that allow to guide the generation with sketching or partial modeling of a shape. Our technical contribution to enable this exploration-based approach is the introduction of a label regression neural network coupled with shape encoder/decoder networks. The label regression network takes the user-provided keywords and maps them to distributions in the latent space. We show that our method allows users to explore the shape space and generate a variety of shapes with selected high-level attributes.;"[Jahan, Tansin; Guan, Yanran; Kaick, Oliver] Carleton Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada";;Jahan, T (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;;44;0;0;0;1;MAY;2021;40;2;115;126;;10.1111/cgf.142619;http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.142619;WOS:000657959600010;View Full Record in Web of Science

Inspired by these successes, researchers are now applying deep generative modeling techniques to the generation and optimization of molecules-in our review we found 45 papers on the subject published in the past two years. These works point to a future where such systems will be used to generate lead molecules, greatly reducing resources spent downstream synthesizing and characterizing bad leads in the lab. In this review we survey the increasingly complex landscape of models and representation schemes that have been proposed. The four classes of techniques we describe are recursive neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning. After first discussing some of the mathematical fundamentals of each technique, we draw high level connections and comparisons with other techniques and expose the pros and cons of each. Several important high level themes emerge as a result of this work, including the shift away from the SMILES string representation of molecules towards more sophisticated representations such as graph grammars and 3D representations, the importance of reward function design, the need for better standards for benchmarking and testing, and the benefits of adversarial training and reinforcement learning over maximum likelihood based training.;"[Elton, Daniel C.; Boukouvalas, Zois; Fuge, Mark D.; Chung, Peter W.] Univ Maryland, Dept Mech Engn, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Boukouvalas, Zois] Amer Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Elton, Daniel C.] NIH, Ctr Clin, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA";;"Elton, DC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Mech Engn, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.;Elton, DC (corresponding author), NIH, Ctr Clin, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.";daniel.elton@nih.gov;188;206;205;46;240;Aug 01;2019;4;4;828;849;;10.1039/c9me00039a;http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9me00039a;WOS:000484198500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this talk, we will introduce Hulu's recent technical progresses in recommender systems and deep-dive into the topic of generating recommendation reason from knowledge graph. We have two user scenarios: the store-shelf and autoplay. The first requires a list of videos to maximize the chance that a viewer would pick one of them to watch. The second requires a sequence of video recommendations such that the viewer would continuously watch within the current session. In the model layer, we designed specific models to match with each user scenario, balancing both exploitation and exploration. For example, we leverage the contextual-bandit model in the store-shelf scenario to adapt the ranking strategy to various types of user feedbacks. To optimize exploitation, we tested several granularity levels for parameter sharing among the arms. For more effective exploration, we incorporate Thomason sampling. For the autoplay scenario, we use a contextual recurrent neural network to predict the next video that the viewer is going to watch. In the feature and data layer, we train embeddings for content, user and contextual info. For example, to train content embeddings, we collect factual tags from metadata, sentiment tags from reviews, and keywords from the captions and object/action recognized using computer vision techniques. Next we will deep-dive into one important topic: generating recommendation reason from knowledge graph. A fact is defined by a tuple of related entities and their relation, which is normally a pair of entities tagged by a relationship. In our problem setting, recommendation results are the targets, viewed as inputs for the reasoning task, consisting of pairs of relevant entities, i. e. a source node and a destination node in a knowledge graph. The recommendation reasoning task is to learn a path or a small directed acyclic subgraph, connecting the source node to the destination node. Since the facts in a knowledge graph have different confidence values for different reasoned targets, we need to conduct a probabilistic inference. The challenge is we do not know a pre-defined set of logic rules to guide the search through the knowledge graph, which prevents us from directly applying the probabilistic logic methods. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning, especially in graph neural networks, attention mechanism and deep generative models, we propose two ways to model the reasoning process: the differentiable reasoning approach and the stochastic reasoning approach. Differentiable reasoning approaches are based on graph neural networks [ 1,2] with attention flow and information flow. The attention dynamics is an iterative process of redistributing and aggregating attention over the knowledge graph, starting at the source node. The final attention aggregated at the destination node serves for the prediction to compute the loss. Instead of the prediction accuracy, we care more about how the learned attention dynamics draws its reasoning track in a knowledge graph. Stochastic reasoning approaches frame the reasoning process as learning a probabilistic graphical model consisting of stochastic discrete operations, such as selecting a node and selecting an edge, to build a reason subgraph extracted from the knowledge graph. The model is known as stochastic computation graphs (SCGs), and to learn it, we propose a generalized backpropagation framework Backprop-Q [ 3] to overcome the gradient-blocking issues in applying standard back-propagation. In summary, we give an overview of the recommendation research in Hulu and deep-dive into our differentiable reasoning approach and stochastic reasoning approach for generating recommendation reasons based on a knowledge graph.;"[Xu, Xiaoran; Chen, Laming; Zu, Songpeng; Zhou, Hanning] Hulu LLC, Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA";;Xu, XR (corresponding author), Hulu LLC, Santa Monica, CA 90404 USA.;"xiaoran.xu@hulu.com; laming.chen@hulu.com; songpeng.zu@hulu.com; eric.zhou@hulu.com";3;2;2;0;6;;2018;;;482;482;;10.1145/3240323.3241730;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3241730;WOS:000458675100076;View Full Record in Web of Science

Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classification, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the field as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classification algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.;"[Van Engelen, Jesper E.; Hoos, Holger H.] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci, Leiden, Netherlands; [Hoos, Holger H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Comp Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada";;van Engelen, JE (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Adv Comp Sci, Leiden, Netherlands.;jesper.van.engelen@gmail.com;213;411;411;81;281;FEB;2020;109;2;373;440;;10.1007/s10994-019-05855-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-019-05855-6;WOS:000517069700006;View Full Record in Web of Science

Many time-domain simulation (TDS)-based and transient energy function (TEF)-based methods have been proposed to assess the transient stability of the power system. With the wide area measurement system (WAMS) and the phasor measure units (PMUs) applied to observe the real-time data, methods of TSA based on the machine learning and data-driven are continuously studied. These kinds of methods can only assess the transient stability of the power system when subjected to large disturbances. However, these kinds of methods cannot infer the type of event which leads to the collapse of the power system. In this article, the gated graph neural network (GGNN) is applied to assess the power system transient stability and infer the type of event leading the instability of the power system. First, conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is applied to generate unstable samples making the training data more balanced. With the balanced data graph-structured and used to train the GGNN-based TSA model, the GGNN-based TSA model achieves better performances. Finally, the real-time data is input into the trained TSA model and the transient stability of the power system is assessed. When the power system is considered unstable, the proposed TSA model can also infer the type of event leading the instability of the power system, classifying the unstable state to the corresponding event. Simulations performed on the New England 39-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.;"[Zhou, Xiaomei; Guan, Xin; Peng, Jialiang] Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Data Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China; [Sun, Di; Jiang, Haiyang] State Grid Heilongjiang Elect Power Co Ltd, Dispatching & Control Ctr, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China; [Jin, Yan] Hainayun Technol Co Ltd, IoT Ctr, Qingdao 266000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Zhang, Yan] Simula Metropolitan Ctr Digital Engn, Dept Digital Engn, N-0167 Oslo, Norway";;Guan, X (corresponding author), Heilongjiang Univ, Sch Data Sci & Technol, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China.;"2181784@s.hlju.edu.cn; guanxin.hlju@gmail.com; 5210000@163.com; jhy_03@126.com; pengjialiang@hlju.edu.cn; jinyan11@haier.com; yanzhang@ieee.org";44;0;0;8;8;Jun 15;2022;9;12;9320;9331;;10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127895;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3127895;WOS:000808096100025;View Full Record in Web of Science

The ability to do this is of great significance in network analysis. However, beyond the classic spectral clustering and statistical inference methods, there have been significant developments with deep learning techniques for community detection in recent years--particularly when it comes to handling high-dimensional network data. Hence, a comprehensive review of the latest progress in community detection through deep learning is timely. To frame the survey, we have devised a new taxonomy covering different state-of-the-art methods, including deep learning models based on deep neural networks (DNNs), deep nonnegative matrix factorization, and deep sparse filtering. The main category, i.e., DNNs, is further divided into convolutional networks, graph attention networks, generative adversarial networks, and autoencoders. The popular benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and open-source implementations to address experimentation settings are also summarized. This is followed by a discussion on the practical applications of community detection in various domains.

In the real world, a relation type may only depend on certain attribute features of nodes. Most existing multiplex network embedding methods only focus on preserving consistent information or complementary information from multiplex networks. However, these methods ignore the dependency between node attributes and the topology of each relation. To address the problem, we propose a model called DAME (Disentangled-based Adversarial Network for Multiplex Network Embedding). We utilize generative adversarial learning to preserve the consistent and complementary information between different relation types. Meanwhile, we develop a disentangled graph convolution network (DGCN) based on disentangled learning, enabling DAME to capture the dependency between node attributes and each relation type. We conduct extensive experiments on five realworld datasets.

To do so, this paper first analyzes the edge-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) to find unique characteristics. The deep model-based entity alignment method is developed based on their unique characteristics. The proposed method performs the entity alignment using a graph which is not topological but data-centric, to reflect the characteristics of the edge-specific KGs, which are mainly composed of the instance entities rather than the conceptual entities. In addition, two deep models, namely BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) for the concept entities and GAN (generative adversarial networks) for the instance entities, are applied to model learning. By utilizing the deep models, neural network models that humans cannot interpret, it is possible to secure data on the edge systems. The two learning models trained separately are integrated using a graph-based deep learning model GCN (graph convolution network). Finally, the integrated deep model is utilized to align the entities in the edge-specific KGs. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we perform the experiment and evaluation compared to the state-of-the-art entity alignment methods with the two experimental datasets from DBpedia, YAGO, and wikidata.
