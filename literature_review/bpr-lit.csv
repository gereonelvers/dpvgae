Several related methods exist that enable the step-by-step redesign of business processes. However, these methods are mainly performed manually and require both creativity and business process expertise, which is often hard to combine in practice. To enhance the quality and effectiveness of business process redesign, this paper presents a conceptualization of assisted business process redesign (ABPR). The ABPR concept guides users in improving business processes based on redesign patterns. Depending on the data at hand, the ABPR concept classifies four types of recommendations that differ in their level of automation. Further, this paper proposes a reference architecture that provides operational support for implementing ABPR tools. The ra has been instantiated as a prototype and evaluated regarding its applicability and usefulness in artificial and naturalistic settings by performing an extensive real-world case study at KUKA and interviewing experts from research and practice.;"[Fehrer, Tobias; Fischer, Dominik A.; Roeglinger, Maximilian] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Bayreuth, Germany; [Fehrer, Tobias; Fischer, Dominik A.; Roeglinger, Maximilian] Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, Bayreuth, Germany; [Leemans, Sander J.

Companies are exploring use cases in the hope of reaping benefits from this technology. However, to achieve the desired impact, it is not sufficient to merely replace existing technologies. Current business processes must be redesigned to realize benefits. This paper shows how a number of best practices for Business Process Redesign can be applied to leverage blockchain technology. Specifically, we adapt these best practices for redesigning processes intended to execute on blockchain. We further explore their applicability using a case study. The major elements of process redesign for blockchain are: (1) changing the view from intra- to inter-organizational processes by using the shared data ledger of blockchain, (2) using smart contracts performers of tasks and connectors of processes, (3) using blockchain as means for data communication, and (4) using tokens to manage digitally represented assets.;"[Milani, Frederik; Stepanyan, Lilit] Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Tartu, Estonia; [Garcia-Banuelos, Luciano] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Monterrey, Mexico; [Reijers, Hajo A.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Informat & Comp Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands";Milani, F (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Comp Sci, Tartu, Estonia.;"milani@ut.ee; luciano.garcia@tec.mx; h.a.reijers@uu.nl; lilit.stepanyan@ut.ee";Garcia-Banuelos, Luciano/R-1277-2016;Garcia-Banuelos, Luciano/0000-0001-9076-903X;37;1;1;2;6;2325-6354;;978-1-7281-6473-1;;2020;;;209;216;;10.1109/EDOC49727.2020.00033;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EDOC49727.2020.00033;8;"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";WOS:000630246800023;View Full Record in Web of Science

Business process redesign (BPR) has been widely adopted as an organizational change method in the 1990s. Although BPR projects provide the possibility of dramatic performance improvement, many organizations have encountered serious problems due to the lack of commitment to such projects and the difficulty of systematic targeting of critical processes. By identifying the cause-effect relationships within an organization, we try to address these issues. We propose a cognitive map based method, called two-phase cognitive modeling (TCM), to help organizational members identify potential organizational conflicts, capture core business activities, and suggest ways to support the necessary organizational change. To apply the method in the real world context, we developed a prototype modeling tool, called two-phase cognitive modeling facility (TCMF). Working procedures of the TCM method and TCMF features are illustrated with their application to the real BPR project of a dairy company. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The company was faced with increasing customer demand for a newly developed product line that it had not yet integrated into its appropriate production areas. It also had not clearly identified the long-term responsibilities of the engineering group it had assembled to support this new product line. A cross-functional team was charged to work on a business process redesign project, specifically targeting the quoting process (a bottleneck operation). It was intended not only to improve the quoting process, but also to force the clarification of the responsibilities of the new engineering group and thereby move them closer to integration with production function.

Business process efficiency can be assessed with operational (e.g. time, cost or quality) as well as structural indicators (on the basis of business process model's structure). The use of operational OR structural indicators depends on the context: operational indicators can be used only when the process has already been established or implemented in the company, where structural indicators can be used already in the phase of business process model design. The advantage of structural indicators is their possibility to assess business process efficiency before the process starts and costs increase (e.g. with implementation). In literature, many various structural indicators are presented, which give different efficiency assessment for the same business process model. Here, we propose a uniform assessment method for measuring business process model structural efficiency. The process redesign and the way of uniform structural efficiency assessment is presented using as a case study selected core processes in one of the most successful Slovenian health services organization.;"[Urh, Benjamin; Zajec, Maja; Kern, Tomaz; Krhac, Eva] UM, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia";Urh, B (corresponding author), UM, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia.;benjamin.urh@um.si;Zajec, Maja/AAA-2339-2020;"Zajec, Maja/0000-0002-4019-9072; Urh, Benjamin/0000-0002-2579-2759";30;1;1;4;10;2195-4356;;"978-3-030-17269-5; 978-3-030-17268-8";;2019;;;16;32;;10.1007/978-3-030-17269-5_2;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-17269-5_2;17;"Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical";WOS:000490711700002;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper explores the relationships between the two concepts. Specifically, this paper focuses on three main concerns: how IA supports BPR, how the lack of IA hinders BPR, and what approach to IA can facilitate BPR? The paper begins with a brief review of the development and implementation of each concept. This is followed by an examination of how IA and BPR are related to business processes, both existing and newly designed processes. This analysis, in conjunction with results from field research, provide the basis for nine propositions regarding the BPR and IA relationship. In support of BPR, IS professionals have the opportunity not only to contribute to a firm's business objectives, but also to begin to achieve IA's promise while avoiding some of IA's past implementation problems. It is hoped that further research based on these propositions will lead to more complete answers and perhaps more specific questions on the BPR/IA relationships.;"UNIV S CAROLINA,COLL BUSINESS ADM,COLUMBIA,SC 29208; UNIV S CAROLINA,CTR INFORMAT MANAGEMENT & TECHNOL RES,COLUMBIA,SC 29208";;;;;59;11;11;0;2;;;;FEB;1995;26;1;30;42;;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science";WOS:A1995RR56000007;View Full Record in Web of Science

Information technology plays an important role by either enabling or constraining successful BPR This paper explores the links between firm-wide IT infra-structure and business process change. IT infrastructure is the base foundation of the IT portfolio, which is shared throughout the firm in the form of reliable services, and is usually coordinated by the IS group. IT infrastructure capability includes both the technical and managerial expertise required to provide reliable physical services and extensive electronic connectivity within and outside the firm. Exploratory case analysis of four firms (two in retail and two in petroleum) was used to understand the ways IT infrastructure contributes to success in implementing BPR. The finding was that all firms needed a basic level of IT infrastructure capability to implement BPR. The firms that had developed a higher level of IT infrastructure capabilities, before or concurrent with undertaking business process redesign, were able to implement extensive changes to their business processes over relatively short time frames. The higher level of infrastructure capability was provided in the form of (1) a set of infrastructure services that spanned organizational boundaries such as those between functions, business units, or firms, and (2) the ability of the infrastructure to reach particular constituencies inside and outside the firm to transfer information and process complex transactions. The more extensive business process changes were more innovative and radical, crossing business and functional unit boundaries, and resulted in more significant business impact. The practical implication of the study is that before embarking on any form of BPR, managers should complete a business audit of their IT infrastructure capabilities, as these capabilities have an important impact on the speed and nature of business process change.;"Gartner Grp Pacific, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Business Sch, Carlton, Vic 3053, Australia; AT Kearney, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Broadbent, M (corresponding author), Gartner Grp Pacific, 620 Bourke St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.;"marianne.broadbent@gartner.com; p.weill@mbs.unimelb.edu.au";;;48;248;252;1;98;0276-7783;;;JUN;1999;23;2;159;182;;10.2307/249750;http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/249750;24;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:000081494400003;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the broadest sense, BPR includes nearly any kind of systematic effort by companies to realign their business processes so that they are more competitive. Successful business process redesign can lead to dramatic improvements in productivity and quality. But BPR typically requires vast amounts of time and money to implement, since extensive employee input is necessary during the redesign process. Group Decision Support Software (GDSS) provides a viable alternative to the traditional BPR approach. GDSS is defined as computer-based information systems used to support intelligent, collaborative work. This technology allows multiple users to meet and discuss topics simultaneously via a computer network, thus increasing employee commitment while decreasing time and cost. This paper describes a business process redesign project that was conducted for a division within a large government agency fall of 1993. The BPR was done using a type of Group Decision Support Software called Group Systems V. A services marketing tool called service mapping was also used to identify customer needs and interfaces. Data were collected throughout the project to measure employee attitudes about the redesign process and the GroupSystems technology. Time to complete tasks was also recorded. The results of the study showed that the business process redesign was accomplished more effectively in a shorter period of time than with traditional BPR methods previously used. Participants also indicated that the service mapping tool provided a perspective that is missing from many BPR approaches: an understanding of the service from the customer's perspective.;"Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Chico Coll Business Accounting & Management Sci, Chico, CA 95929 USA; Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Chico Coll Business, Dept Finance & Mkt, Chico, CA 95929 USA";Corbitt, GF (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Chico Coll Business Accounting & Management Sci, Chico, CA 95929 USA.;;;;9;10;10;0;17;0926-2644;;;MAR;2000;9;2;97;107;;10.1023/A:1008750520257;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008750520257;11;"Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";WOS:000085993400002;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper gives an overview of heuristic rules that can support practitioners to develop a business process design that is a radical improvement of a current design. The emphasis is on the mechanics of the process, rather than on behavioral or change management aspects. The various best practices are derived from a wide literature survey and supplemented with experiences of the authors. To evaluate the impact of each best practice along the dimensions of cost, flexibility, time and quality, a conceptual framework is presented that synthesizes views from areas such as information systems development, enterprise modeling and workflow management. The best practices are thought to have a wide applicability across various industries and business processes. They can be used as a check list for process redesign under the umbrella of diverse management approaches such as Total Cycle Time compression, the Lean Enterprise and Constraints Management.

However, the existing studies have focused on proposing theoretical models, methodologies, and redesign patterns, whereas, the BPR activity remains dependent upon domain experts with little or no consideration to end-user feedback. To facilitate these experts, in this study, we have proposed a natural language processing (NLP) based approach to identify redesign suggestions from end-user feedback in natural language text. The proposed approach includes a novel set of annotation guidelines that can be used to generate computational resources for business process redesign. Secondly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have generated computational resources which are composed of three real-world business processes and end-user feedback containing 8421 sentences. Finally, we have performed 270 experiments using six traditional and three deep learning techniques to evaluate their effectiveness for the identification of redesign suggestions from raw text. The classified suggestions can be used by domain experts to prioritize the redesign possibilities, without going through the details of the customer feedback.;"[Mustansir, Amina] Univ Punjab, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Software Engn, Lahore, Pakistan; [Shahzad, Khurram] Univ Punjab, Dept Data Sci, Lahore, Pakistan; [Malik, Muhammad Kamran] Univ Punjab, Dept Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan";Mustansir, A (corresponding author), Univ Punjab, Dept Comp Sci, Dept Software Engn, Lahore, Pakistan.;"amina.mustansir@pucit.edu.pk; khurram@pucit.edu.pk; kamran.malik@pucit.edu.pk";Shahzad, Khurram/GRX-8200-2022;Mustansir, Amina/0000-0003-1031-6730;29;0;0;4;7;0928-8910;1573-7535;;MAY;2022;29;1;;;12;10.1007/s10515-021-00316-8;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10515-021-00316-8;24;Computer Science, Software Engineering;WOS:000737064300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach Motivated by the Three Waves of BPM research, IoT-enabled context-awareness is, therefore, expected to be achieved for enhancing the business process design, which pilots a new wave of BPR (Business Process Redesign/Reengineering) to enable the business process coevolve with IoT and analytics. This paper reports an illustrative case study of BPR in a Chinese bulk port, one of the hub seaports that widely adopted IoT technologies over the last few years. Findings The IoT implementation and data analytics has increased the efficiency and improve the monitoring effectively. The proposed IoT-CaBPM framework availably helps to identify and match nodes of IoT devices, business decisions and analytic models in order to redesign a business process towards context-aware variability. As IoT is rapidly becoming the new dominant IT paradigm is moving towards mature implementation in various industries, the corresponding BPR must be planned and executed strategically for achieving better benefits. Originality/value Despite some research extend BPM standard by integrating IoT devices as a sort of resources or report generically that the ports operations are affected by IoT, there is still a lack of layers from the IoT infrastructure to context-aware business processes. An industrial BPR case with business models in detail is also a lack for presenting the specific implications and effectiveness of the adoption of such technologies.

According to the proponents, business process redesign is an all-or-nothing affair. Numerous books and articles on the topic promulgate the notion that reengineering is nothing short of a revolution. But the rhetoric can be daunting-and may mislead managers planning to reengineer their organizations. Our field research on 15 business process redesign projects suggests that only one of the two phases of reengineering effort needs to be revolutionary for the project to reach field implementation. Reengineering involves both the design-the blue-print for change-and the implementation of those plans. Reengineering design phase must have elements of radical change. The radicalness instills motivation in ways that move evolutionary projects cannot. But as companies implement the plans, they can-and many do-use a more evolutionary change process, and still gain effective results. Our results provide support to the emerging body of literature that argues that organizations combine evolutionary and radical change harmoniously.

To support business process reengineering (BPR) efforts, we propose a framework based on high-level Petri nets. This framework is used to model and analyse business processes. The use of high-level Petri nets provides us with advanced analysis techniques and sophisticated software tools. To support the use of this Petri-net-based framework, we also present the ''What, how and by whom?'' approach. This approach has been developed to guide the application of the framework in a BPR setting. The ''What, how and by whom?'' approach identifies three important stages in the (re)design of a business process. By passing through these stages we obtain a complete Petri net model of the current (As-is) or proposed (To-be) situation, whereupon Petri-net-based analysis techniques can be used to verify the correctness and estimate the performance of the (re)designed business process.;;vanderAalst, WMP (corresponding author), EINDHOVEN UNIV TECHNOL,DEPT MATH & COMP SCI,POB 513,5600 MD EINDHOVEN,NETHERLANDS.;;van der Aalst, Wil/G-1248-2011;van der Aalst, Wil/0000-0002-0955-6940;15;77;77;1;9;0166-3615;;;JUL;1996;29;01.

These organizations have gained fewer benefits from the introduction of information technology then manufacturing companies. An explanation for this finding is that current information system design methodologies do not provide the appropriate tools. They are directed at analyzing and designing information systems for control and do not make a distinction between information handling processes that are part of the control system of an organization and information processes that are part of the production system. The business process redesign approach that gets more and more attention offers a way of thinking and designing to overcome these shortcomings. Comparing business process redesign with information systems design makes the strong points of both visible.

Our focus is on the reduction of throughput times and service times by exploiting business process redesign techniques, i.e. rules of thumb that aim to optimise the business process by improving its tasks, its routing structure, the resource organisation, etc. We define a redesign approach based on a set of existing redesign heuristics (Reijers, 2003) and apply this approach in a mental healthcare case. We show seven alternative redesigns for an intake process and evaluate their impact on throughput times and service times. Our conclusion is that the approach is feasible and results in a fruitful input for the organisation in question. This result is in line with results from the evolutionary approach of (Buchanan, 1998). The application of best practices in the mental healthcare setting shows its potency in this specific context and very similar settings.

J;"Mansar, SL; Reijers, HA";"Mansar, SL; Reijers, HA";Best practices in business process redesign: validation of a redesign framework;COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY;English;Article;"BPR; case study; survey; framework; best practices";BPR;A fundamental challenge in any Business Process Redesign (BPR) project is to come up with a new process design that is in one or more ways superior to the existing plan. Based on earlier research, a framework to help the designer in selecting the proper best practice(s) for this purT)ose is presented and validated in this paper. It is described how the framework is used in generating improved process designs for two Dutch organisations. Furthermore, the results from a survey are presented, which has been carried out among BPR practitioners in the UK and the Netherlands to test the framework. The overall conclusion is that the framework is indeed helpful in supporting process redesign and that its core elements are recognised and put in practice by the BPR practitioner community. The framework, therefore, may be of direct interest to both academics and practitioners active in the process improvement field. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - A demonstrative case was developed using simulation of alternative scenarios of cycle service levels (CSL) and product flexibility, etc. to determine the value of postponement (VOP) in a manufacturing process integrated with a supply process. Findings - It was shown that by managing the knowledge on existing processes and developing an innovative mindset for managers, it is possible to derive significant benefits by redesigning the processes. The financial benefits in terms of the VOP showed significant savings even at high service levels desired in automotive supply chains. The need to identify judicious level of flexibility to benefit from postponement strategy was observed to be important. Research limitation/implications - A pragmatic data set reflecting the operating conditions was used to show the potential benefits. There is a need to generalize the results with alternative data sets. Additional research will be expedient to enrich some of the useful possibilities identified in this industry research effort. Practical implications - Postponement strategies can offer significant benefits if the knowledge of existing supply chain and manufacturing processes is used to innovate new integrated process redesigns. These benefits may be usefully measured by the industrial managers as the VOP. The VOP is dependent on CSLs as well as the flexibility requirements due to the multiple automotive models. Originality/value - In the knowledge and innovation context this is a useful industrial research effort in the organization to redesign the external (supply chain) processes with proper collaboration and redesign of the internal (manufacturing) processes leading to significant potential benefits as shown by the VOP under various scenarios.;"Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110016, India; Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China";Wadhwa, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.;swadhwa@mech.iitd.ernet.in;Chan, Felix T.S./O-8875-2016;Chan, Felix T.S./0000-0001-7374-2396;33;15;15;2;19;0263-5577;1758-5783;;;2006;106;03.

This study represents an early attempt at examining the strategic nature of the phenomenon. Because BPR is radical change and has the ability to alter both the competitive and operational nature of the corporation, it is critical that BPR be coordinated with corporate strategy. Through a survey of information system executives, the relationships between corporate competitive strategy and three types of BPR - intrafunctional, interfunctional and interorganizational - were examined. It was found that organizations following a cost strategy tended to do more BPR projects on interfunctional processes. Furthermore, the positive effect of a cost strategy on interfunctional BPR was found to be strengthened by the degree of integration of IS and business planning. It was also found that while interorganizational BPR was not related to a specific strategy, it was strongly related directly with IS-business planning integration.;;FIEDLER, KD (corresponding author), UNIV S CAROLINA, COLL BUSINESS ADM, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USA.;;;Grover, Varun/0000-0001-5367-2423;69;16;16;2;11;0960-085X;1476-9344;;FEB;1995;4;1;17;30;;10.1057/ejis.1995.3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ejis.1995.3;14;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:A1995QX91000003;View Full Record in Web of Science

That is, management schools (of thought) that emphasize certain types of work structures usually appear earlier than IT geared at supporting those work structures. This situation has undoubtedly changed recently, arguably around the mid-1990s, with the explosion in the commercial use of the Internet and particularly the Web. A first step towards a new management framework to help organizations benefit from modern Web-based IT is proposed and discussed in this paper. Our goal is to provide some basic elements that can be used by managers and researchers as a starting point for a broader management model. As such, we focus on a particular set of activities associated with team coordination and communication in production and service delivery business processes.

Despite the mature body of knowledge, computational support is considered as a highly relevant research gap for redesigning business processes. Therefore, this paper applies Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that, on a conceptual level, mimic the BPM lifecycle - the most popular BPM approach - by incrementally improving the status quo and bridging the trade-off between maintaining well-performing design structures and continuously evolving new designs. Beginning with describing process elements and their characteristics in matrices to aggregate process information, the EA then processes this information and combines the elements to new designs. These designs are then assessed by a function from value-based management. This economic paradigm reduces designs to their value contributions and facilitates an objective prioritization. Altogether, our triad of management science, BPM and information systems research results in a promising tool for process redesign and avoids subjective vagueness inherent to current redesign projects.;"[Afflerbach, Patrick] Fraunhofer FIT, Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Hohendorf, Martin; Manderscheid, Jonas] Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany";Manderscheid, J (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Univ Str 12, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.;"patrick.afflerbach@fim-rc.de; MHohendorf@gmx.de; jonas.manderscheid@fim-rc.de";;;68;3;3;2;18;1387-3326;1572-9419;;OCT;2017;19;5;1101;1121;;10.1007/s10796-016-9715-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-016-9715-1;21;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";WOS:000410186100010;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the exact impact of these redesign best practices on workflow performance. This study proposes an approach that can be used to quantify the impact of a business process redesign project on all dimensions of workflow performance. The approach consists of a large set of performance measures and a simulation toolkit. It supports the quantification of the impact of the implementation of redesign best practices, in order to determine what best practice or combination of best practices leads to the most favorable effect in a specific business process.

A possible approach to business process redesign is using redesign best practices. A previous study identified a set of 29 different redesign best practices (Reijers, 2003). However, little is known about the exact impact of these redesign best practices on workflow performance. This study proposes an approach that can be used to quantify the impact of a business process redesign project on all dimensions of workflow performance. The approach consists of a large set of performance measures and a simulation toolkit. It supports the quantification of the impact of the implementation of redesign best practices, in order to determine what best practice or combination of best practices leads to the most favorable effect in a specific business process. The approach is developed based on a quantification project for the parallel best practice and is validated with two other quantification projects, namely for the knockout and triage best practices.;"[Jansen-Vullers, M.

However, a number of projects have failed to generate the expected benefits due to a gap between KM activities and those that constitute the routines of an organization, as defined in its business processes. This paper draws on the idea that the association of KM practices and organizational routines is essential to companies' success nowadays to put forth an integrated process redesign and knowledge management methodology. With this goal, some of the foremost KM frameworks were analyzed to identify the tasks that are essential to the effective management of organizational knowledge. Then, the compatibility between such tasks and the procedures defined by major process redesign methodologies were evaluated. This analysis supported the elaboration of a revised methodology that integrates the principles and techniques of both types of initiatives. The adoption of the proposed methodology should elicit the creation of business processes that harmonize an efficient, low cost operation and the systematization of an organization's knowledge creation, storage, transfer and reuse activities.;[Moreno, Valter] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA;Moreno, V (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;;Moreno, Valter/M-4278-2013;Moreno, Valter/0000-0002-1782-2401;37;3;4;3;37;1413-9936;;;JAN-MAR;2012;17;1;203;230;;10.1590/S1413-99362012000100012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-99362012000100012;28;Information Science & Library Science;WOS:000303202100012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Three distinctive levels of culture must be recognized in process redesign-national, corporate and work group culture. American national culture has the most profound influence. Individualism and autonomy are key features of American culture that work against the logic of process integration and commonization by rewarding individuals for pursuing their own self-interests. This tendency also generates a lack of trust, which in turn creates barriers to sharing electronic data. Reengineering difficulties are exacerbated by an American fascination with technological solutions, and a view of new technology as a ''silver bullet'' that yields benefits automatically. Often, process redesign cannot be implemented without culture change. Culture can be influenced by exposing internal groups to external pressures, ensuring employee participation in reengineering, recognizing that training alone does not achieve culture change, redefining group boundaries, managing anti-champions, building trust, and leveraging the strengths of national and corporate culture.;WAYNE STATE UNIV,DEPT IND & MFG ENGN,DETROIT,MI 48202;Baba, ML (corresponding author), WAYNE STATE UNIV,DEPT ANTHROPOL,DETROIT,MI 48202, USA.;;;;19;23;23;0;14;0895-6308;;;NOV-DEC;1996;39;6;44;54;;10.1080/08956308.1996.11674321;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08956308.1996.11674321;11;"Business; Engineering, Industrial; Management";WOS:A1996VP40200017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Our research develops a theoretical framework for process design that is aimed at providing practical guidelines for process managers. The abundance of context-specific case studies which exist today share many success stories but provide little in terms of a general methodological approach. In this paper, we describe our general framework for the analysis and design of business processes. We outline a typical business process and critically evaluate typical pre- and post-reengineering process design issues. Explicit aspects of our analysis address workflow design, task bundling, technological enablers, and performance-based incentives. We examine the effects of task size asymmetry and performance information asymmetry on the optimal process design. Our results indicate that, with increased asymmetry, certain types of process designs become more desirable. Furthermore, we look at the interaction between job asymmetry and other process design factors such as knowledge intensity and level of job customization. Finally, we show when asymmetry can cause process reengineering efforts to complement the classic performance-based incentive compensation model. Practical implications of our results are illustrated for a variety of process design cases.;;Seidmann, A (corresponding author), UNIV ROCHESTER,WILLIAM E SIMON GRAD SCH BUSINESS ADM,ROCHESTER,NY 14627, USA.;;;;27;47;51;0;5;0925-5273;;;Jun 16;1997;50;02.

Designing an improvement is complex; it requires familiarity with the process under consideration and vast knowledge and expertise in the field of business processes. Therefore, there is no substitute for an expert judgment while designing a process improvement. Yet, experts' knowledge is limited by their experience. In this paper, we present our vision of supporting more informed expert decisions. This vision is based on designing a knowledge-based solution in order to facilitate sharing experience from past cases gained by various organizations. More specifically, this paper focuses on the first step that is required for constructing a knowledge base: designing its structure. To formulate a representative structure, we studied cases reported in literature and formulated a baseline structure grounded in the reviewed literature. We examined its coverage for additional cases originating in literature and added additional features where needed, until we reached saturation. The proposed structure distinguishes between the features that characterize a situation that leads to a redesign act and the set of improvement actions performed as a result.";"[Kettler, Neta; Soffer, Pnina; Hadar, Irit] Univ Haifa, 199 Aba Khoushy Ave, Haifa, Israel";"Kettler, N; Soffer, P; Hadar, I (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, 199 Aba Khoushy Ave, Haifa, Israel.";"Neta.kettler@gmail.com; spnina@is.haifa.ac.il; hadari@is.haifa.ac.il";;;50;1;1;2;4;1865-1348;;"978-3-030-20618-5; 978-3-030-20617-8";;2019;352;;3;18;;10.1007/978-3-030-20618-5_1;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20618-5_1;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";WOS:000492375600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

One aspect that received little attention, however, is the relationship between business process modeling choices and redesign success. This research gap is addressed through a multi-methods study of 18 business process redesign projects conducted in 18 different organizations. A structural equation model is developed and tested based on data collected from those projects; the results are then triangulated with qualitative data. The structural equation model depicts relationships between the following broad perceptual constructs: communication flow orientation of a business process model, quality of a business process model, and business process redesign success. The communication flow orientation of a business process model is defined as the extent to which a model explicitly shows how communication interactions take place in a process. A model's perceived quality is defined as the degree to which the model presents the following perceptual sub-constructs: ease of generation, ease of understanding, completeness, and accuracy. The results of the study suggest that the degree of communication flow orientation of a business process model is significantly related to the model's perceived quality. Perceived model quality, in turn, is significantly related to perceived business process redesign success. interestingly. a business process model's perceived completeness does not seem to be influenced by a model's communication flow orientation. The structural equation model accounted for 56% of the explained variance in the business process redesign success construct. The main implication of this study is that a focus on communication flows in business processes is an important ingredient in successful business process redesign projects. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many methodologies have been developed to support this undertaking. However, most of the methodologies are designed to fit large and established organizations especially those in developed countries. They appear mechanistic, top down and insensitive to different contexts and are therefore not suitable for the realities of Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries (DCs). Meanwhile, SMEs in DCs face competition and other challenges which require them to innovate in order to survive or grow in the volatile economic and business climate. Hence, they need an alternative BP redesign methodology to support process oriented management. In response, this paper follows a design science approach and exploits Alter's work system method to design a practical and procedural methodology that can be followed in business process redesign for SMEs in DCs. The proposed methodology consists of four main iterative phases and their supporting activities and relies on the concept of alignment to produce effective business processes. The methodology is justified on the basis of business process redesign literature and appropriate theoretical frameworks. Its value lies in its agile and context sensitive nature as required by SMEs in DCs. It is novel in that, to our knowledge, it is the first time the work system method is being exploited for BP redesign though that possibility has been previously noted.;"[Laar, David Sanka; Seymour, Lisa] Univ Cape Town, Dept Informat Syst, Rondebosch, South Africa";Laar, DS (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Dept Informat Syst, Rondebosch, South Africa.;"LRXDAV013@myuct.ac.za; Lisa.Seymour@uct.ac.za";;Laar, David/0000-0002-5747-1829;56;1;1;0;3;2049-6818;2049-6826;978-1-911218-27-2;;2017;;;512;519;;;;8;Management;WOS:000404892000063;View Full Record in Web of Science

Several management-oriented approaches have been proposed showing how to make BPR work. However, detailed descriptions of empirical experience are few. Consistent engineering methodologies to aid and guide a BPR-practitioner are currently emerging. Often, these methodologies are claimed to be developed for business process modelling, but stem directly from information system design cultures. We consider an engineering methodology for BPR to consist of modelling concepts, their representation, computerized tools and methods, and pragmatic skills and guidelines for off-line modelling, communicating, analyzing, (re)designing business processes. The modelling concepts form the architectural basis of such an engineering methodology. Therefore, the choice, understanding and precise definition of these concepts determine the productivity and effectiveness of modelling tasks within a BPR project. The current paper contributes to engineering support for BPR. We work out general issues that play a role in the development of engineering support for BPR. Furthermore, we introduce an architectural framework for business process modelling and redesign. This framework consists of a coherent set of modelling concepts and techniques on how to use them. The framework enables the modelling of both the structural and dynamic characteristics of business processes. We illustrate its applicability by modelling a case from service industry. Moreover, the architectural framework supports abstraction and refinement techniques. The use of these techniques for a BPR trajectory are discussed.;;Franken, HM (corresponding author), TELEMAT RES CTR,POB 589,NL-7500 AN ENSCHEDE,NETHERLANDS.;;;Ferreira Pires, Luis/0000-0001-7432-7653;0;2;2;0;0;;;0-412-78910-8;;1997;;;103;120;;;;18;"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing";WOS:A1997BH38A00010;View Full Record in Web of Science

The project used a participative approach involving soft OR and systems thinking, an approach that was developed in earlier projects in food retailing and mining. The aim of the project was initially to conduct a benchmarking exercise and develop an information systems (IS) strategy. As the project progressed the emphasis moved to business process redesign and downsizing in the light of new perceptions of business prospects. The paper describes the design and implementation of the intervention, the evolution of the project, the problems encountered, and the outcome. Throughout it describes in some detail the interaction that took place. Although many improvements to current operations were identified for implementation, it proved difficult to obtain agreement to a fundamental change in the organisational structure. Two years after the project finished a new organisation based on the project's analysis has been adopted. The case is discussed drawing on a number of recent theoretical themes that have emerged from the debate about the process of OR. Conclusions are drawn about the value of the methods used in the intervention, the practicalities of mixing several methods, and the future direction the research programme should take.

Although literature on BPR is available in abundance, little concrete support on how to get from as is towards to be is available [12]. We propose the use of an evolutionary redesign approach that is based on BPR best practices to fill this gap. The approach is evolutionary in nature, because local updates are made to an existing process. In this paper we focus on one part of the approach: the generation of redesign alternatives. The first step in the generation of an alternative process is the selection of a process part for redesign. This is followed by a process transformation that determines an alternative for this selected part. Finally, the original process part is replaced by the transformed part resulting in the alternative process. Using Petri net analysis techniques the correctness Of Such a redesign generation is ensured.;"[Netjes, Mariska; Reijers, Hajo A.; van der Aalst, Wil M.

This paper describes a technique that should reduce that risk by developing a systematic process redesign method that we call Dynamic Process Modeling (DPM). It integrates customer-oriented process modeling with computerized visual process simulation to promote better understanding of the required process and determine its performance through simulation of the proposed redesign alternatives prior to selection and implementation. We compare DPM with four other implementation-level process modeling methods using eight criteria to demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world hospital BPR case.

The project involves collecting examples of how different organizations perform similar processes, and organizing these examples in an on-line process handbook. The handbook is intended to help people: (1) redesign existing organizational processes, (2) invent new organizational processes (especially ones that take advantage of information technology), and (3) share ideas about organizational practices. A key element of the work is an approach to analyzing processes at various levels of abstraction, thus capturing both the details of specific processes as well as the deep structure of their similarities. This approach uses ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about managing dependencies. A primary advantage of the approach is that it allows people to explicitly represent the similarities land differences) among related processes and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process could be performed. In addition to describing this new approach, the work reported here demonstrates the basic technical feasibility of these ideas and gives one example of their use in a field study.;"MIT, Ctr Coordinat Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Syracuse Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; Univ Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Michigan State Univ, Sch Ind & Labor Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; Fidel Investments, Boston, MA USA; Babston Coll, Wellesley, MA USA";Malone, TW (corresponding author), MIT, Ctr Coordinat Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;;"Crowston, Kevin/C-6068-2008; Pentland, Brian/AAT-9506-2021; Dellarocas, Chrysanthos/N-3950-2018; Wang, Charles/B-5565-2011";"Crowston, Kevin/0000-0003-1996-3600; Pentland, Brian/0000-0001-7526-2476; Dellarocas, Chrysanthos/0000-0001-6105-0130; Wang, Charles/0000-0001-9331-8437";80;287;305;0;86;0025-1909;1526-5501;;MAR;1999;45;3;425;443;;10.1287/mnsc.45.3.425;http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.45.3.425;19;"Management; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000082215800012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, the research question of the study is: how do IoT technologies redesign the business processes of seaports? Design/methodology/approach - The paper reports the illustrative case study of the German Port of Hamburg, one of the main European seaports, which widely adopted technologies based on IoT over the last few years. Findings - The results show the adoption of IoT technologies widely redesigns and improves the performance of all the main business process of the port analyzed, in particular those processes related to technology and information of the organization. The IoT-driven business process redesign (BPR) must be planned strategically by the port management and implies the involvement of all the port stakeholders and, if necessary, the hiring external professional partners. Originality/value - Despite some authors report generically which are the ports operational domains more affected by IoT, there is a lack of studies about the specific implications of the adoption of such technologies on the BPR of seaports.

The effectiveness of BPR was also facilitated by recent advances in process mining and analytics, given the influence of Big Data to the way organizations discover, monitor and improve their processes. This swift in research focus has left a considerable gap in literature regarding the evaluation of the redesign capacity of business process (BP) models prior to redesign method implementation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of BP model plasticity, i.e., a new process quality characteristic inspired by brain neuroplasticity that measures the capability of a BP model to be redesigned based on particular BPR heuristics. We claim that the applicability of BPR heuristics to process models is directly affected by internal measures related to each heuristic and their correlation may predict the BPR effectiveness. This paper applies a state-of-the-art method for calculating the model plasticity based on regression analysis and the application of the bender method on empirical data. The measurement is conducted on BPMN models from literature and the extracted thresholds proved effective on classifying the level of plasticity. The approach contributes to the BPR domain by offering a quantitative evaluation of thresholds that reflect the applicability of heuristics prior to implementation. This can prove a useful tool for the facilitation of inexperienced modelers towards more effective redesign decisions.;"[Tsakalidis, George; Vergidis, Kostas; Tambouris, Efthimios] Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece";Tsakalidis, G (corresponding author), Univ Macedonia, Dept Appl Informat, Thessaloniki, Greece.;"giorgos.tsakalidis@uom.edu.gr; kvergidis@uom.edu.gr; tambouris@uom.edu.gr";;;63;0;0;0;0;2378-1963;;978-1-6654-2069-3;;2021;;;31;41;;10.1109/CBI52690.2021.00014;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CBI52690.2021.00014;11;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000848150600004;View Full Record in Web of Science

The popular reengineering literature advocates employee empowerment - decentralizing decision authority and consolidating tasks - as complementary process redesign strategies. Our analysis reveals, however that decentralization and consolidation decisions can occur separately, or together; the optimal combination depends on the relative effectiveness of the technology aimed at skill enhancement and the sensitivity of customers to delivery time and quality. We identify those process parameters that can cause decentralization and consolidation to have opposite effects on process performance; we also point at other parameters such as customer to customer variability which can cause them to complement one another.

Through their interaction with their varied stakeholders-from actors within their supply chains to educational and financial institutions-knowledge intensive enterprises are increasingly becoming a key component of regional economic stability. Within their complex environment, these organisations lack the support of suitable frameworks to inform their efforts to optimise, adapt and improve their underlying business processes in order to maximise the efficiency of their performance and pursue growth ambitions. This paper examines the distinct nature of knowledge intensive entrepreneurial ventures (KIEs) and the applicability of current business process improvement (BPI) frameworks to their setting. Finally, a KIE-oriented business process improvement framework is developed through an integrative adaptation of the concepts of knowledge intensity and knowledge management to the principles of business process redesign and re-engineering reported in existing literature. The proposed framework contributes to the existing literature in the subject of BPI modelling for knowledge intensive entrepreneurial ventures by addressing a distinct set of improvement concerns that this type of organisations face at a process level.;"[Sallos, Mark P.; Yoruk, Esin; Garcia-Perez, Alexeis] Coventry Univ, Fac Business & Law, Ctr Business Soc, Coventry, W Midlands, England";Sallos, MP (corresponding author), Coventry Univ, Fac Business & Law, Ctr Business Soc, Coventry, W Midlands, England.;"SallosM@uni.coventry.ac.uk; Esin.Yoruk@coventry.ac.uk; Alexeis.Garcia-Perez@coventry.ac.uk";"Perez, Alexeis Garcia/Y-9548-2019; Yoruk, Esin/ABH-8933-2020";"Perez, Alexeis Garcia/0000-0003-0718-5645; Yoruk, Esin/0000-0001-5795-2369";66;15;15;0;44;0892-9912;1573-7047;;APR;2017;42;2;354;373;;10.1007/s10961-016-9534-z;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-016-9534-z;20;"Engineering, Industrial; Management";WOS:000401479900009;View Full Record in Web of Science

Business process evaluation indicators tend to focus on process performance only, neglecting the definition of indicators to evaluate other concerns of interest in different phases of the business process lifecycle. Moreover, they usually do not discuss specifically which data must be collected to calculate indicators and whether collecting these data is feasible or not. This paper proposes a business process assessment framework focused on the process redesign lifecycle phase and tightly coupled with process mining as an operational framework to calculate indicators. The framework includes process performance indicators and indicators to assess whether process redesign best practices have been applied and to what extent. Both sets of indicators can be calculated using standard process mining functionality. This, implicitly, also defines what data must be collected during process execution to enable their calculation. The framework is evaluated through case studies and a thorough comparison against other approaches in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, these organizations do not have the opportunity to exploit the potential of execution logs for analyzing the performance of their processes. As a first step towards facilitating these organizations, in this paper, we argue that customer feedback is a valuable source of information that can provide important insights about process performance. However, a key challenge to this approach is that the feedback includes a significant amount of comments that are not related to process performance. Therefore, utilizing the complete feedback without omitting the irrelevant comments may generate misleading results. To that end, firstly, we have generated a customer feedback corpus of 3356 comments. Secondly, we have used two well-established BPM frameworks, Devil's Quadrangle and Business Process Redesign Implementation framework, to manually classify the comments as relevant and irrelevant to process performance. Finally, we have used five supervised learning techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the two frameworks for their ability to automatically identify performance relevant comments. The results show that Devil's Quadrangle is more suitable framework than Business Process Redesign Implementation framework.;"[Ahmad, Sanam; Muzaffar, Syed Irtaza; Shahzad, Khurram; Malik, Kamran] Univ Punjab, Punjab Univ Coll Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan";Shahzad, K (corresponding author), Univ Punjab, Punjab Univ Coll Informat Technol, Lahore, Pakistan.;"sanam.ahmad@pucit.edu.pk; irtaza@pucit.edu.pk; khurram@pucit.edu.pk; kamran.malik@pucit.edu.pk";Shahzad, Khurram/GRX-8200-2022;Shahzad, Dr. Khurram/0000-0001-8433-6705;22;2;2;0;0;1865-1348;1865-1356;"978-3-319-92898-2; 978-3-319-92897-5";;2018;316;;55;69;;10.1007/978-3-319-92898-2_5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-92898-2_5;15;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering";WOS:000717034400005;View Full Record in Web of Science

BPS models an mostly used to model and experiment with structural business process changes (i.e. changes to the process layout). However, in the light of increasing attention being paid to Information Systems-enabled organisational change, a need has emerged for incorporating the effect of informational business process changes as well (i.e. changes that occur as a result of the introduction of an Information System). Given the growing importance of Information Systems as business process change enablers, the perceived inadequacy of BPS models to incorporate such changes may render simulation's applicability and usefulness doubtful in many practical applications. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to translating Information Systems impacts into simulation model input and output parameters. Potential implications of IS impacts for BPS model development and experimentation are also discussed.;Brunel Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Comp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England;Giaglis, GM (corresponding author), Brunel Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Comp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.;;;;27;1;1;0;0;;;1-56555-167-2;;1999;;;172;177;;;;6;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Industrial";WOS:000081232100032;View Full Record in Web of Science

C;"Kumar, A; Indradat, P";"Kumar, Akhil; Indradat, Paronkasom";Optimizing Process Model Redesign;SERVICE-ORIENTED COMPUTING, (ICSOC 2016);English;Proceedings Paper;;"BUSINESS PROCESS REDESIGN; PATTERNS";In recent years there has been considerable interest in business process redesign. A process model may be redesigned by combining various tasks and services according to best practices so as to satisfy predefined business rules and constraints to achieve a specific purpose. This purpose may be stated in terms of functional goals (such as desired or acceptable process behavior) and non-functional goals like cost, time and quality of service. There are many ways to redesign a process instance by applying improvements such as: making a task optional, replacing a task by another faster task (or service), task postponement, task combination, task splitting, task restructuring, etc. Given many such alternatives, there is no systematic way of evaluating their costs and benefits, and the tradeoffs among them. We describe a novel approach based on a formal model to optimize the benefits or net effects of a redesign with respect to a baseline design and show how it can be used to evaluate and compare alternative models at both design and run time.;"[Kumar, Akhil] Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Indradat, Paronkasom] Penn State Univ, Dept Ind Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA";Kumar, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;"akhil@psu.edu; pxi5005@psu.edu";Indradat, Paronkasom/AGZ-8643-2022;;22;3;3;0;3;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-319-46295-0; 978-3-319-46294-3";;2016;9936;;39;54;;10.1007/978-3-319-46295-0_3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46295-0_3;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";WOS:000388131200003;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, experience in this context indicates a lack of comprehension of essential elements and their mutual relationships that can contribute to the success of business-process change-implementation efforts. This article proposes a framework for managing IT for effective business-process redesign (BPR) implementation. After establishing BPR principles, components, and the relationship of BPR to some organizational and technological approaches, it presents the role and benefits of IT in BPR. The article then discusses in detail the core elements of the framework.

J;Kim, HW;Kim, HW;Business process versus coordination process in organizational change;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS;English;Article;"business-process redesign; coordination theory; organizational process change; simulation";;Organizational change has been a key component in enhancing performance and organizational design. Previous process-oriented organizational change methods, however, focused on simplifying process flow without examining how it affects other organizational elements. Since an organization consists of several interdependent elements, a change within an organization can affect the other dependent organizational elements. Lack of coordination within an organization can result in unexpected poor performance and high coordination cost. In this research, we suggest a coordination theory approach to organizational process change by applying the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Process Handbook with simulation technique. For the validity test, we applied the Process Handbook to a real hospital. From the application case, we saw that the proposed approach is useful in minimizing the risk of the change project by validating change alternatives using simulation technique, coordinating the dependent organizational elements, and managing change effects on other organizational elements. In this article, we discuss the proposed method and the transformation of a new organizational design to the workflow system development.;MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Ctr Coordinat Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA;Kim, HW (corresponding author), MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Ctr Coordinat Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;;;;16;12;12;0;4;0920-6299;;;OCT;2000;12;4;275;290;;10.1023/A:1008122132391;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008122132391;16;"Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000090048700003;View Full Record in Web of Science

While process redesign methods provide structure to redesign projects, they provide limited support during the actual creation of to-be processes. More specifically, existing approaches hardly develop an ontological perspective on what can be changed from a process design point of view, and they provide limited procedural guidance on how to derive possible process design alternatives. This paper aims to provide structured guidance during the to-be process creation. Design/methodology/approach Using design space exploration as a theoretical lens, the authors develop a conceptual model of the design space for business processes, which facilitates the systematic exploration of design alternatives along different dimensions. The authors utilized an established method for taxonomy development for constructing the conceptual model. First, the authors derived design dimensions for business processes and underlying characteristics through a literature review. Second, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with professional process experts. Third, the authors evaluated their artifact through three real-world applications. Findings The authors identified 19 business process design dimensions that are grouped into different layers and specified by underlying characteristics. Guiding questions and illustrative real-world examples help to deploy these design dimensions in practice. Taken together, the design dimensions form the Business Process Design Space (BPD-Space). Research limitations/implications Practitioners can use the BPD-Space to explore, question and rethink business processes in various respects. Originality/value The BPD-Space complements existing approaches by explicating process design dimensions. It abstracts from specific process flows and representations of processes and supports an unconstrained exploration of various alternative process designs.;"[Gross, Steven; Mendling, Jan] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Data Proc & Knowledge Management, Vienna, Austria; [Stelzl, Katharina] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Bayreuth, Germany; [Grisold, Thomas; vom Brocke, Jan] Univ Liechtenstein, Inst Informat Syst, Vaduz, Liechtenstein; [Roglinger, Maximilian] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr Finance & Informat Management, Project Grp Business & Informat Syst Engn Fraunho, Bayreuth, Germany";Gross, S (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Data Proc & Knowledge Management, Vienna, Austria.;"steven.gross@wu.ac.at; katharina.stelzl@fim-rc.de; thomas.grisold@uni.li; jan.mendling@wu.ac.at; maximilian.roeglinger@fim-rc.de; Jan.vom.Brocke@uni.li";Röglinger, Maximilian/GQH-4037-2022;;102;6;6;16;48;1463-7154;1758-4116;;Jan 12;2021;27;8;25;56;;10.1108/BPMJ-03-2020-0116;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-03-2020-0116;32;"Business; Management";WOS:000607829700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite rapid developments in the business process management discipline during the last decade, a comprehensive overview of the options to methodologically support a team to move from as-is process insights to to-be process alternatives is lacking. As such, no safeguard exists that a systematic exploration of the full range of redesign possibilities takes place by practitioners. Consequently, many attractive redesign possibilities remain unidentified and the improvement potential of redesign initiatives is not fulfilled. This systematic literature review establishes a comprehensive methodological framework, which serves as a catalog for process improvement use cases. The framework contains an overview of all the method options regarding the generation of process improvement ideas. This is established by identifying six key methodological decision areas, e.g. the human actors who can be invited to generate these ideas or the information that can be collected prior to this act. This framework enables practitioners to compose a well-considered method to generate process improvement ideas themselves. Based on a critical evaluation of the framework, the authors also offer recommendations that support academic researchers in grounding and improving methods for generating process improvement ideas. Next to the framework and its critical evaluation, this review investigates the research procedures of the studies that were used to create the framework. Related to this investigation, academic researchers can find additional guidance regarding procedures for building and evaluating new methods.;"[Vanwersch, Rob J.

Consider, for example, material requirements planning (MRP) as part of current enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which is mainly driven by the bill of material (BOM). For information-intensive products such as insurances, and many other services, the workflow process typically evolves or is redesigned without careful consideration of the structure and characteristics of the product. In this paper, we present a method named product-based workflow design (PBWD). PBWD takes the product specification and three design criteria as a starting point, after which formal models and techniques are used to derive a favorable new design of the workflow process. The ExSpect tool is used to support PBWD.

However, expectations of the influence of IT in BPR as well as aspects of the organization which influence IT, may far outweigh the actual results. A panel of experts was questioned and 43 businesses currently undergoing reengineering were examined in order to determine a 'divergence' between expectations and observations on the role of IT in BPR. The organizational groups within the businesses consisted of business managers, executives, administrative/staff personnel, IT personnel, and consultants actually involved in reengineering projects. The study sought answers to three research questions: Are there significant differences in IT in BPR expectations and observations?, Do they vary by constituency group?, and Do they vary according to the level of organizational IT effectiveness? The study identified three factors that represent significant differences in these shortfalls.

J;Hoff, R;Hoff, Rainer;Quantifying the Effectiveness of Interventions in Workflows;JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING;English;Article;"business process redesign; workflow intervention; reminders; notifications; best practices; performance measurements";;Workflows are common in today's business world, and are an integral part of current enterprise content management, product lifecycle management, and enterprise resource planning systems. When a task assignee does not complete a task on time, workflow systems are commonly configured to send out reminders. Reminders are a form of intervention in the workflow. It is tacitly assumed that workflow intervention is effective, yet, to date, there has been no quantitative characterization of the benefits of workflow intervention. This study first develops a mathematical model for workflow intervention. The controlling parameters are identified: the choice of probability distribution, the skewness of the probability distribution, the intervention interval, and the effectiveness of individual interventions. To the extent that closed-form solutions are available (e.g., for uniform or triangular probability density functions), they are presented. More generally, results are presented by representing the wait time using the Weibull probability density function. Cases where closed-form solutions are intractable are simulated using the Petri net method. Results indicate that, while interventions always reduce the mean cycle time for a workflow, there are certain circumstances where the cycle time reduction is dramatic (i.e., >50%).[DOI: 10.1115/1.3330446];Gateway Consulting Grp Inc, E Amherst, NY 14051 USA;Hoff, R (corresponding author), Gateway Consulting Grp Inc, 8610 Transit Rd, E Amherst, NY 14051 USA.;rhoff@gatewaygroup.com;;;7;0;0;0;3;1530-9827;1944-7078;;JUN;2010;10;2;;;21002;10.1115/1.3330446;http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.3330446;7;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Manufacturing";WOS:000278575300002;View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, despite its high diffusion, many organizations complain about the low returns they have achieved with it and many experts stress its risks or criticize. Other methodologies surveyed are unwieldy and have problems such as long periods of implementation, or the high effort, knowledge and training required for use. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology for process improvement simple and effective, by which is possible to identify areas of process improvement from its modeling. The result is an agile and effective methodology that consists of seven stages by which it is possible to identify both possible improvements in process and improvements that are not technically feasible. All this with low training requirements and low cost. The main contributions of the proposed methodology are, therefore, its simplicity, ease of use and communication, its graphic aspect and its flexibility to adapt to different companies, sectors or types of processes.;"[Alarcon-Valero, Faustino; Eva-Alemany Diaz, Maria del Mar; Jeanpierre-Laguardia, Frederic] Univ Politecn Valencia, CIGIP, Valencia 46022, Spain";Alarcon-Valero, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, CIGIP, Cami de Vera S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.;faualva@omp.upv.es;"del Mar Eva Alemany-Díaz, María/J-2194-2015; Valero, Faustino Alarcón/I-1004-2012";"del Mar Eva Alemany-Díaz, María/0000-0002-0992-8441; Valero, Faustino Alarcón/0000-0002-0783-3932";35;1;1;1;28;0012-7361;1989-1490;;SEP-OCT;2012;87;5;566;573;;10.6036/4585;http://dx.doi.org/10.6036/4585;8;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;WOS:000309194400015;View Full Record in Web of Science

Though, business processes are exposed to different risks that may cause failures in their execution. In order to preserve this value, applying risk management principles in Business process management discipline has become a field that takes a lot of attention. Risk-aware Business Process Management (R-BPM) is an area that combines the advantages of Business Process Management and Risk Management. Some works tried to propose approaches for mitigating risks but only in the execution phase. Our research work aims to mitigate risks by design using a method based on a risk analysis technique HAZOP (HA-Zard OP-erability). In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly introduce an approach for analyzing business process models using an adaptation of HAZOP, propose recommendations for reducing risks and we will then plan actions to implement those recommendations by design. Afterward, we will propose a redesign for the business process model and consequently get an improvement for the original model.;"[Lhannaoui, Hanane; Kabbaj, Mohammed Issam; Bakkoury, Zohra] MOHAMMED V Univ Agdal, EMI, AMIPS Res Grp, Dept Comp Sci, Rabat, Morocco";Lhannaoui, H (corresponding author), MOHAMMED V Univ Agdal, EMI, AMIPS Res Grp, Dept Comp Sci, Rabat, Morocco.;"Lha.hanane@gmail.com; kabbaj@emi.ac.ma; bakkoury@emi.ac.ma";KABBAJ, Mohammed Issam/F-7254-2013;KABBAJ, Mohammed Issam/0000-0002-8595-0456;23;1;1;0;12;;;978-1-4799-0299-6;;2013;;;;;;;;8;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic";WOS:000326649800032;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, none of these parties has a proper overview over the whole set of activities executed. Therefore, none of the parties can take the lead in business process redesign. Business processes are often not described in an explicit manner, and therefore they are not available for analysis. However, in the information system of each supply chain party, partial information about the business process are recorded. We claim that the overall distributed process can be induced, by using this partial information of all involved parties. In this paper we present an overview of methods available to discover processes across supply chains, based on the assumption that there is a common point of reference at all involved parties, e.g. an order number. Such an induced or discovered process enables analysis across the supply chain, and can become an important tool to facilitate business process redesign in networked organizations.;Eindhoven Univ Technol, Fac Technol Management, I&T Dept, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands;Maruster, L (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Fac Technol Management, I&T Dept, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands.;;"van der Aalst, Wil/G-1248-2011; Wortmann, Johan C/J-9677-2012";"van der Aalst, Wil/0000-0002-0955-6940; ";15;1;1;0;3;1571-5736;;1-4020-7542-1;;2003;129;;219;230;;;;12;"Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing";WOS:000186386000016;View Full Record in Web of Science

With most existing approaches to business process (re-)design focusing on process efficiency, customers are often treated as second-class citizens. Despite emergent research on customer process management, there is a lack of guidance on how to design customer-centric business processes. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a structured literature review and analyzed companies awarded for outstanding customer centricity to compile design heuristics for customer-centric business processes. The authors iteratively validated and refined these heuristics with experts from academia and industry. Finally, the heuristics was grouped according to their expected impact on interaction capabilities to enable their prioritization in specific settings. Findings The authors proposed 15 expert-approved and literature-backed design heuristics for customer-centric business processes together with real-world examples. The heuristics aim at increasing customer satisfaction with interaction-intensive core processes, which is an important driver of corporate success. Originality/value The design heuristics complement existing efficiency-centered (re-)design heuristics. They reflect cognitive shortcuts that support process analysts in the generation of innovative ideas during process (re-)design. The heuristics also add to customer process management and help put customer centricity into practice.;"[Frank, Lukas; Poll, Rouven; Rupprecht, Lea] Univ Augsburg, Res Ctr FIM, Augsburg, Germany; [Roeglinger, Maximilian] Univ Bayreuth, Res Ctr FIM, Fraunhofer FIT, Project Grp BISE, Bayreuth, Germany";Roglinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Res Ctr FIM, Fraunhofer FIT, Project Grp BISE, Bayreuth, Germany.;maximilian.roeglinger@fim-rc.de;Röglinger, Maximilian/GQH-4037-2022;;73;5;5;2;22;1463-7154;1758-4116;;;2020;26;6;1283;1305;;10.1108/BPMJ-06-2019-0257;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-06-2019-0257;23;"Business; Management";WOS:000525269800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This is done by elaborating the design process of a case from industry in both systems. From this evaluation we concluded that current case handling systems are not yet completely ready for supporting PBWD.

A staged representation depicts the improvement path for SOA adoption. Each stage has its own characteristics and the stages are logically connected. The move from one stage to the next requires methods, processes, tools, and techniques. The existing methods mainly differ in terms of the centered building block; it is often challenge for an enterprise to decide on methods as the SOA motivations and requirements vary for different stages of SOA adoption. In this context, an enterprise has to model its SOA adoption path in terms of the methodical requirements at different stages. This work proposes a horseshoe model to understand the transformations from initial stages of SOA adoption to an optimized stage.

The purpose of this paper is to explore an alternative dimension to process mining in which the objective is to extract process constraints (or business rules) as opposed to business process models. It also focusses on an alternative data set - process models as opposed to process instances (i.e. event logs). Design/methodology/approach - The authors present a new method of knowledge discovery to find business activity sequential patterns embedded in process model repositories. The extracted sequential patterns are considered as business rules. Findings - The authors find significant knowledge hidden in business processes model repositories. The hidden knowledge is considered as business rules. The business rules extracted from process models are significant and valid sequential correlations among business activities belonging to a particular organization. Such business rules represent business constraints that have been encoded in business process models. Experimental results have indicated the effectiveness and accuracy of the approach in extracting business rules from repositories of business process models. Social implications - This research will assist organizations to extract business rules from their existing business process models. The discovered business rules are very important for any organization, where rules can be used to help organizations better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty. Originality/value - There has very been little work in mining business process models as opposed to an increasing number of very large collections of business process models.

Although there are many attempts to establish a qualitative business process redesign framework, there is little work on quantitative business process analysis and optimization. Furthermore, most of the attempts to analyze and optimize a business process are manual without involving a formal automated methodology. Business process optimization can be classified as a scheduling problem, expressed as the selection of alternative activities in the appropriate sequence for the available resources to be transformed and thus satisfy the business process objectives. This chapter provides an overview of the current research about business process analysis and optimization and introduces an evolutionary approach. It demonstrates how a business process design problem can be modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved using existing techniques. An illustrative case study is presented to demonstrate the results obtained through three multi-objective optimization algorithms. It is shown that multi-objective optimization of business processes is a highly constrained problem with fragmented search space.

Therefore, enterprise leaders are increasingly prone to adopt business process improvement (BPI) practices. However, organizations are unable to implement formal and reusable solutions, representing a gap between academic research and practical use. In addition, companies adopt discipline-dependent solutions, lacking BPI representations of best practices applicable to all organizational divisions. This paper aims to propose some constructs on top of the Quintessence kernel for representing the practice systematic development of the BPI in the BPI lifecycle and we conduct two case studies in a multinational company. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was adopted for recognizing gaps in previous approaches and identifying best BPI practices. Subsequently, characterization of practices and activities are represented based on a unified definition model and the Quintessence kernel. Finally, two case studies are developed for applying the solution. Findings The formal representation is applicable to multiple disciplines in organizational environments. Besides, the sub-alphas (abstract level progress health attribute) states and the work products resulting from each activity completion criteria evidence the health and progress accomplished during the practice execution. Originality/value The practice representation serves as a formal, graphical, reusable and multidiscipline guide compiling activities and tasks for systematically developing BPI during the radical/incremental improvement lifecycle.;"[Vera, Antonio; Mario Zapata, Carlos] Univ Nacl Colombia, Sede Medellin, Comp & Decis Sci Dept, Medellin, Colombia";Vera, A (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Sede Medellin, Comp & Decis Sci Dept, Medellin, Colombia.;avera@unal.edu.co;;"Vera, Antonio/0000-0002-5581-8008; Zapata-Jaramillo, Carlos Mario/0000-0002-0628-4097";84;0;0;1;1;1463-7154;1758-4116;;MAY 20;2022;28;3;876;903;;10.1108/BPMJ-10-2021-0687;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-10-2021-0687;28;"Business; Management";WOS:000791150700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, every step in the methodology presented in this paper, including the design phase, aim to reduce the risk of failure. Practical implications - Name is the most communicated characteristic of a department; however, this most communicated characteristic of the departments has always been the most neglected characteristic as well. For the first time in the literature, this paper provides a description on how to use the power of departmental names to promote the main customer values expected from each department. Originality/value - Added to a detailed guideline on the new process design and process names, this paper presents a new marketing mix model with a process-oriented delegation of authority view, which may be of interest to the marketing researchers and practitioners.";[Khosravi, Ali] Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia;Khosravi, A (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW, Australia.;ali.khosravi@mq.edu.au;;;87;8;9;1;41;1463-7154;1758-4116;;;2016;22;1;116;139;;10.1108/BPMJ-02-2015-0012;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-02-2015-0012;24;"Business; Management";WOS:000370162400006;View Full Record in Web of Science

One prominent solution to manage and coordinate Web services is the use of workflow technology. For more than two decades now, workflow management systems architectures, language specifications, and workflow analysis techniques have been extensively studied. While these areas of research have made the development of sophisticated workflow systems possible, one important research area that has been overlooked is the lifecycle of process application development. As a result, current process management systems support the analysis, enactment, and ad hoc design of workflows, but they lack the tools and methods to assist process design. The purpose of our study is to present a framework to assist and guide process analysts and designers in their task. The Poseidon framework includes a participative and an analytical design method. The participative phase uses a clean sheet approach and starts by constructing a business case table which captures all the business cases represented by a process. Afterward, an analytical design phase is followed where scheduling functions are derived from the business case table and are used to build the structure of a process.;Univ Madeira, Dept Math & Engn, P-9000390 Funchal, Portugal;Cardoso, J (corresponding author), Univ Madeira, Dept Math & Engn, P-9000390 Funchal, Portugal.;jcardoso@uma.pt;;Cardoso, Jorge/0000-0001-8992-3466;36;5;5;0;1;0218-8430;1793-6365;;MAR;2006;15;1;23;55;;10.1142/S021884300600127X;http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S021884300600127X;33;Computer Science, Information Systems;WOS:000235907700002;View Full Record in Web of Science
J;"Vergidis, K; Tiwari, A; Majeed, B";"Vergidis, K.; Tiwari, A.; Majeed, B.";Business process improvement using multi-objective optimisation;BT TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL;English;Article;;PROCESS MODELS;Business process redesign and improvement has become an increasingly attractive subject in the wider area of business process intelligence. Although there have been many attempts to establish a business process redesign framework, there is little work on the actual optimisation of business processes with given objectives. Furthermore, most of the attempts to optimise a business process are manual and do not involve a formal automated methodology. This paper proposes a process improvement approach for automated multi-objective optimisation of business processes. The proposed framework uses a generic business process model that is formally defined. The formal definition of business processes is necessary to ensure that the optimisation will take place in a clearly defined, repeatable and verifiable way. Multi-objectivity is expressed in terms of process cost and duration as two key objectives for any business process. The business process model is programmed and incorporated into a software optimisation platform where a selection of multi-objective optimisation algorithms can be applied to a business process design. This paper outlines a case study of business process design that is optimised by the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimisation algorithm NSGA2. The results indicate that, although business process optimisation is a highly constrained problem with fragmented search space, a number of alternative optimised business processes that meet the optimisation criteria can be produced.

Our hermeneutic study of text and text analogues in two organizations reveals that the use of computer-based BPC tools can have two opposing effects on redesign effectiveness. We find that, consistent with the existing literature, such tools can indeed enhance redesign effectiveness by providing: 1) a structure to the redesign process; 2) cognitive support to the redesigners; and 3) a mode for standardized representation of the redesigns. However, we also discover that the autonomization of electronically represented redesigns and the organizational members' subsequent focus on standardized, detailed, and objectified representations (rather than on socially shared understandings) of the redesign, can lead to an alienation of the original redesigners from the business processes that they envisioned. This alienation, further amplified as a result of frequent and sometimes meaningless changes to the electronically objectified redesigns mandated by other BPC stakeholders in the organization, can contribute to inconsistencies in the redesign, thus resulting in a negative influence of BPC tools on redesign effectiveness. Our study 1) illustrates the use of the hermeneutic circle to understand the role of computer-based tools in business process redesign; 2) argues that the role of BPC tools can be better understood by focusing on the sociotechnical interaction of the redesigners with the BPC tools in an organizational context rather than by studying the tools in isolation; and 3) indicates that the effect of tools on redesign effectiveness depends on the relative strengths of the two opposing effects of BPC tool use discussed above.";"Washington State Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23284 USA";Sarker, S (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Informat Syst, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.;sarkers@cbe.wsu.edu;;Lee, Allen/0000-0002-6924-050X;56;26;26;0;12;0018-9391;;;FEB;2006;53;1;130;145;;10.1109/TEM.2005.861806;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2005.861806;16;"Business; Engineering, Industrial; Management";WOS:000235175900011;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents an overview of INCOM Egypt processes using Ould Riva and analyses the process of 'handling a product'. It aims to demonstrate effective automation of the production of wires and cables process accompanied to Industry 4.0 while considering environmental and economic sustainability goals that were inhibited by COVID-19 restrictions. Ould's Riva method is used to analyse the production process of wires and cables to propose improvements for automating the process. Business process modelling is utilised to study the processes for clearer understating. The flow of information within the process is also analysed to integrate the production process with other processes and supply chains, which helps to identify which production activities can be automated and mainstreamed into the information flow to achieve environmental and economic sustainability. The context of INCOM Egypt, as a case study, is presented along with the Riva model of its operations. The paper identifies the before, i.e., As-Is process, and after, i.e., To-Be Process, automation of the 'handle a product' process using the Role Activity Diagram (RAD). The process involved redesigning and improving different activities to increase resource-use efficiency to participate in achieving the goals of sustainability. The focus of this paper is to investigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on sustainability and to examine the accomplishments of process automation of wire production towards environmental and economic sustainability. The results of the research reveal a relationship between business process modelling and sustainability. Moreover, automation of processes (Industry 4.0) is found to reduce the negative effect of COVID-19 on production. A triangulation between process modelling, process automation (Industry 4.0), and sustainability was determined. Each one is reinforcing and impacting one another. The RAD model demonstrates that automation of the activities in the process reduces waste, time, cost, and redundant processes as factors of sustainability, which may also help to lessen the unfavorable effects of the pandemic.

According to our method, an existing BPMN diagram is disassembled into reusable parts containing the desired number of elements. Such elements and structure can work as design patterns and be validated by a user in terms of correctness. In the next step, these component models are categorised considering their parameters such as resources used, as well as input and output data. The classified components may be considered a repository of reusable parts, that can be further applied in the design of new models.

This paper provides a longitudinal view of CIGNA Corporation's experiences in business reengineering since 1989. CIGNA is a leading provider of insurance and related financial services throughout the United States and the world. Between 1989 and 1993, CIGNA completed over 20 reengineering initiatives, saving more than $100 million. Each $1 invested in reengineering has ultimately brought $2-3 in returned benefits. This article describes projects with major payoffs: operating expenses reduced by 42 percent, cycle times improved by 100 percent, customer satisfaction up by 50 percent, quality improvements of 75 percent. It also highlights how CIGNA's reengineering started small and how learning was used to escalate from this quick hit to reengineering larger and more complex parts of the organization. CIGNA's reengineering successes have also required a willingness to allow failure and learn from failures. Only about 50 percent of the reengineering efforts bring the type of benefits expected initially. Repeated trials are often necessary.

While it is technically feasible with PBD to generate a new design from an updated product specification, it may be more efficient to update the existing process design directly when a change is small. In this paper, such small product changes are investigated and it is described how a process design should be changed in accordance with them.

Despite its increasing relevance, the actual process elicitation still poses a major challenge as global distribution of company locations makes the carrying out of process modelling workshops difficult, and especially novices have problems with the modeling itself. To meet these challenges, virtual reality based systems were estimated to be an efficient and promising way. Consequently, this paper deals with the development of a virtual reality application for participatory process modelling. Using the Design Science paradigm, the work identifies issues occurring in business process elicitation from the literature and translates them into meta-requirements. With the help of these meta-requirements, design principles were derived that were considered in the development. Using these design guidelines, a prototype to enable collaborative process elicitation in VR was developed and subsequently evaluated by a focus group.;"[Poehler, Ludger; Schuir, Julian; Luebbers, Simon; Teuteberg, Frank] Osnabruck Univ, Accounting & Informat Syst, Osnabruck, Germany";Pohler, L (corresponding author), Osnabruck Univ, Accounting & Informat Syst, Osnabruck, Germany.;"ludger.poehler@uni-osnabrueck.de; julian.schuir@uni-osnabrueck.de; sluebbers@uni-osnabrueck.de; frank.teuteberg@uni-osnabrueck.de";;;27;0;0;0;0;1865-1348;1865-1356;"978-3-030-52306-0; 978-3-030-52305-3";;2020;391;;375;385;;10.1007/978-3-030-52306-0_27;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52306-0_27;11;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering";WOS:000759772900027;View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the efforts, due to the lack of proper tools and methodologies, they find it difficult to decide which process to redesign and how. Considering the effort spent in the process analysis phase and limited support in the process redesign phase, we find a need for a better process modeling and redesign method. This article introduces the enterprise process reverse engineering (EPRE) method for analyzing business processes and supporting process redesign tasks. By analyzing common business forms, the method provides designers and users with guidance for process redesign as well as in generating the current process model. Working procedures are described using a sample hospital case and a set of the EPRE prototype screens. For validation purpose, we applied the method to a real BPR project for an advertising agency and report on its outcome.

Management of change is a part of safety management, however, changes are often complex and usually involve both technical and organizational aspects. We present a new integrated method (to make a distinction, we name it a Safety change management) to evaluate and manage change proposals, considering both technical and organizational dimensions in an integrated way. This method includes the consideration of applicable management levels within the organization and follows a business process redesign model. A change is evaluated for its impacts and interactions between various management levels (using a set of checklists) and accordingly, planning actions are prepared for validation and monitoring. The method was subject to testing and validation by two industrial organizations via ex-post re-assessments of three recent changes. The proposed method was found detailed, effective, useful and transparent by the plant managers involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This step is called developing an AS-IS business process model. However, many contemporary organizations have invested in developing and sustaining process models of their existing operations, which are often created by domain experts themselves. In case a new redesign project is to be initiated, a dilemma occurs. Is it safe to use a model from the existing collection or should the AS-IS model be developed all over by a BPM specialist? Clearly, an important consideration here is whether AS-IS models developed by domain experts rather than BPM experts is of sufficient quality to drive a redesign effort. To empirically investigate this issue, we examined a business process within a multinational high-tech organization. Unlike most of the studies focused on one specific aspect of quality (e.g. control flow), we used a framework from the literature that covers three quality aspects. The framework was applied to determine the potential problems in the AS-IS model.;"[Arkilic, I. Guven; Goverde, Roy R. H. M.

On account of these investments, senior managers anticipate gains in productivity, which are commensurate with the cost of modern IT and Information Systems. While the evolving capabilities of emerging TT are evident, the association between technological diffusion and increased productivity has not been readily demonstrated in terms of corporate repositioning or scholarly research findings. One possible source of this paradox is the absence or presence of Business Process Redesign in positioning the organization to assimilate and leverage technological innovation. This study empirically examines the nature and magnitude of relationships between IT diffusion, perceived productivity improvement, and process redesign. The findings suggest that process redesign and IT have a complex relationship with productivity, and that these can be represented by a mediating or moderating model for different technologies. The data, while exploratory, do suggest alternate ways to examine the productivity paradox. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

S;Alt, R;Alt, Rainer;BUSINESS NETWORK REDESIGN METHODOLOGIES IN ACTION;BUSINESS PROCESS TRANSFORMATION;English;"Article; Book Chapter";"Electronic Commerce; Business Network Redesign; Portal Engineering";"INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; TECHNOLOGY; COMPUTER; DESIGN";Business network redesign (BNR) has been regarded as the logical step following internal business process redesign. Several methodological approaches have emerged to support a variety of interorganizational redesign aspects. These cover either the allocation of responsibilities among the actors in a business network or the allocation of activities within an interorganizational business process. This chapter elaborates on the constitutional elements of BNR methods and uses them to analyze existing approaches. An important result is a methodology that consistently guides the transformation from a business and a technological perspective is still missing. In view of this deficit and the growing adoption of portal systems, this chapter presents a methodology for the implementation of portals in interorganizational business processes. An in-depth case study illustrates the transformation of the spare parts business at Watch Corp. Key enabler is a portal that has been integrated with a business network consisting of internal departments, external service providers, and suppliers. This research shows the application of BNR methodology at Watch Corp. and concludes with a call for more integrated models across the three architectural layers as well as for an integration of architecture and assessment models.;"[Alt, Rainer] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany; [Alt, Rainer] Univ St Gallen, Inst Informat Management, St Gallen, Switzerland; [Alt, Rainer] Roland Berger & Partners, Dusseldorf, Germany";Alt, R (corresponding author), Univ Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.;;Alt, Rainer/U-6769-2018;Alt, Rainer/0000-0002-6395-0658;65;0;0;0;2;1554-6152;;978-0-7656-1191-8;;2008;9;;207;233;;;;27;"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000283436500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing from dynamic capabilities theory, we conducted a field study using a multiple case study design to examine the following research question: How do organizations achieve dynamic capabilities by using Cloud Computing? We develop a framework that explains how organizations respond to market dynamism by developing sense-and-response strategies that enable them to achieve dynamic capabilities using business process redesign, business network redesign, and business scope redefinition. We discuss how these transformations, in turn, improve organizational outcomes such as service effectiveness and efficiency. Our study also identifies factors that support and hinder the development of dynamic capabilities. Our study contributes to the literature on dynamic capabilities by examining how IT capabilities like cloud computing may accelerate the ability of an organization to achieve dynamic capabilities. We also identify transformational changes of business processes and inter organizational networks that are enabled by cloud computing.

We use an example case of an electronic group buying setting to demonstrate how our approach can be applied in practice. More specifically, we chose a standard business process, the sales process as implemented on a group buying platform, to illustrate how a business process may be redesigned in order to better meet the needs of customers. For that purpose, we introduce a social technology feature to support cooperation among buyers in the sales process and then analyze the performance impact of the proposed business process redesign. We combine principles from design science and experimental economics to aid the business redesign process. To allow for an experimental evaluation in a controlled laboratory setting, we implement a simplified prototype model and an experimental electronic group-buying platform in the laboratory. We then employ the methods of experimental economics to generate process performance data and evaluate the effectiveness of the new process model design in the lab that can provide valuable insights to platform managers for redesigning the real-world system. We posit that combining the principles of design science and experimental economics offers researchers a useful and cost-effective method to systematically evaluate theoretical predictions about process model design.;"[Yu, Yuecheng] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Pelaez, Alexander; Lang, Karl R.] CUNY, Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, New York, NY 10010 USA";Yu, YC (corresponding author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 178902, Singapore.;"martinyu@smu.edu.sg; alex.pelaez@baruch.cuny.edu; karl.lang@baruch.cuny.edu";;;37;2;2;3;29;1617-9846;1617-9854;;NOV;2016;14;4;767;789;;10.1007/s10257-014-0257-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10257-014-0257-0;23;"Business; Management";WOS:000389408400004;View Full Record in Web of Science

While eServices could enable cost savings and improve customer service, the development may be costly and time-consuming, involving complex challenges such as business process redesign, changes in organisational culture and customer behaviour. Adding to the complexity is the hierarchy of goals for eServices at transnational, national and organisational levels. Earlier research emphasise the importance of alignment between an organisation's use of information technology and its business goals. This complex structure of multi-level goals is often implicit and difficult to handle in practice. The purpose of this study is to examine how goal modelling can be utilised to improve eService development in government by serving as a tool for evaluation of goals. In a case study of a Swedish municipality's eService development project, we found goal modelling to be valuable for evaluating goal alignment between the municipality's local action plan, the national action plan and the project plan for the EU project Smart Cities. Other benefits are e. g. the ability to detect missing or implicit goals and tasks and moreover to improve planning, management and evaluation of eService development. The recommendation is to use goal models and an 'alignment matrix' to improve goal alignment and the overall goal quality.;"[Magnusson, Monika; Christiansson, Marie-Therese] Karlstad Univ, Karlstad, Sweden";;"Monika.Magnusson@kau.se; Marie-Therese.Christiansson@kau.se";Magnusson, Monika/AAO-8806-2020;;21;3;3;0;9;;;978-1-908272-12-6;;2011;;;312;320;;;;9;"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Information Science & Library Science";WOS:000307994600038;View Full Record in Web of Science

Organisations frequently initiate a BPR, and vulnerability identification that involves information security experts should follow. In developing countries, many organisations have insufficient experts, causing problems related to the experts' workload. In this study, we propose a new method called Task-based Vulnerability Prediction (TbVP), which uses a machine-learning approach to predict information security vulnerabilities of the business process model. The method utilises the type and label of tasks in the model to predict vulnerabilities in implementing applications. Vulnerabilities data are taken from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) dictionary. Our method consists of two main stages. First, we developed clusters using classification and clustering methods. Second, we built an automatic system to predict vulnerabilities using the clusters obtained from the first stage. Business processes of public universities were used as case studies to evaluate the method. We evaluated the automatic prediction system using the reliability test and comparing vulnerabilities our system predicted with actual vulnerabilities that materialised in the applications. The evaluation result shows that the system is a reliable predictor of application vulnerabilities, which our method can automatically predict based on a business process model, before implementing supporting applications.

In this paper, we propose a different approach for process improvement by first defining and configuring, process KPI target values, and second using Process Mining techniques to discover and analyze deviations from those values. Then, for each deviation we propose improvement solutions based on Business Process redesign patterns. Since this encompasses also an improvement cycle, we present our approach as an extension of the well-known BPM cycle. With this approach, process stakeholders will be able to quickly identify process KPI deviations based on quality, cost, time and flexibility, and resolve them by automatically applying proven redesign patterns.

The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and traditional SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buyside demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.";"[Natanelov, Valeri; Cao, Shoufeng; Foth, Marcus; Dulleck, Uwe] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Natanelov, Valeri; Cao, Shoufeng; Foth, Marcus; Dulleck, Uwe] Food Agil CRC Ltd, 81 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia";"Natanelov, V (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol QUT, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia.;Natanelov, V (corresponding author), Food Agil CRC Ltd, 81 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.";val@nexible.solutions;;;90;0;0;0;0;2467-964X;2452-414X;;NOV;2022;30;;;;100389;10.1016/j.jii.2022.100389;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jii.2022.100389;14;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Industrial";WOS:000863074500003;View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus is on the need to assess business process performance early in the redesign process, to prevent organisational failures. The method is based on human performance quantification and is supported by a tool that enables scenario-based evaluation of prospective organisational processes through simulation. The approach combines probabilistic and subjective measures of tasks and communication acts in business processes to quantify business performance in terms of cycle time. The approach models business processes as a set of scenarios of sequential activities where the dependencies between actors. IT systems and tasks are explicitly defined. Business process performance assessment is achieved through a systematic walkthrough of the process model using these scenarios. Human performance constitutes an important parameter to business process performance and is modelled based on Human Performance Shaping Factors (PSF) and assessed using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN). Process cycle time is calculated using aggregates of task and communication completion times, and calibrated using performance estimates of each of the agents in the scenario. The method enables trade-off analysis among candidate process models and identification of performance bottlenecks early in the design phase. A radiology process improvement case study is presented that demonstrates the use of the method and the tool. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This information system is built upon the organisational infrastructure and is supposed to support the business processes. To study the organisational behaviour in the form of business processes, one needs an effective modelling method to capture dynamics of business processes. In this paper we introduce the DEMO methodology for organisational modelling. An extension of the methodology has been made by incorporating a semiotic method. DEMO is a cross-disciplinary theory for describing and explaining the action of organisations. It contains several model types, each expressed in a specific diagram. They collectively provide the necessary knowledge for information systems development and business process redesign. The process model of DEMO has been discussed in detail in this paper. A need for a facility in DEMO has been identified to formulize rules and conditions for optional and conditional actions. Towards this end, a semiotic method, namely NAM has been chosen as a complement to DEMO for this purpose. After producing process model in terms of DEMO, we use NAM to capture norms (e.g. rules, regulations and conditions). The norms determine the conditions and constrains in controlling optional and conditional actions. They govern the behaviour of actors (agents), normally to decide when certain actions are performed. Norms define clearly the roles, functions, responsibilities and authorities of the actors. The extended DEMO has been applied to a real-life problem for demonstration purposes.

From another viewpoint, the rising currency of Whole-of-Government (WoG) and shared services initiatives signal an unmissable trend toward resource reuse across public service agencies (PSAs) through business process standardization (BPS). This research invokes BPS into process redesign to produce a process redesign framework (PRF) and deploys the same to build a standard process model (SPM) for services of the government of Albania (GoA). Design/methodology/approach The methodology follows the design science research (DSR) paradigm, wherein best practices extracted from literature are synthesized with stakeholder inputs to design the PRF and SPM, both of which are then evaluated with case study research. Findings Adoption of PRF/SPM on a WoG basis will not only reduce service lead time but also enable a variety of public services to share the same process, thereby further saving costs for GoA. The research outputs will accelerate reengineering and subsequent digitalization of public service operations. Research limitations/implications Implementing SPM will maximize resource reuse and help offer uniform and integrated public services to GoA's customers. It will also enable demand-driven staff mobilization across GoA agencies. The proposed PRF/SPM have limitations in that they consider only flow aspects of service processes with aspects of conversion being ignored. Originality/value This research fulfills the need for a systematic approach to process redesign and prepares GoA for a WoG treatment to its BPR efforts.;"[Mukherjee, Kamal K.] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, New Delhi, India; [Reka, Laura; Mullahi, Rudina] Agcy Delivery Integrated Serv, Tirana, Albania; [Jani, Keldi] Agcy Delivery Integrated Serv, Serv Dev, Tirana, Albania; [Taraj, Jonida] Agcy Delivery Integrated Serv, Serv Delivery, Tirana, Albania";Jani, K (corresponding author), Agcy Delivery Integrated Serv, Serv Dev, Tirana, Albania.;Keldijam@adisa.gov.al;;Mukherjee, Kamal K/0000-0002-0649-1176;86;1;1;12;28;1463-7154;1758-4116;;MAY 17;2021;27;3;796;835;;10.1108/BPMJ-03-2020-0107;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-03-2020-0107;40;"Business; Management";WOS:000634181400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Rather than continue the debate about whether BPR is 'good' or 'bad', 'old' or 'new' (e.g. Earl, M.J., 1994. The new and the old of business process redesign. Journal of Strategic information Systems 3 (1), 5-22; Mumford, E., 1994. New treatments or old remedies: is business process reengineering really socio-technical design. Journal of Strategic Information Systems 3 (4), 313-326), the focus here is on understanding how the concept 'BPR', however defined, has been diffused across European firms. The results from a survey of firms in four countries support previous research on the diffusion process with the rate of adoption of BPR related to micro-organisational level variables-characteristics of the firm and the boundary spanning activities of individual members. In addition there were differences across industry sectors and across countries in the extent of adoption of BPR. It is argued that attention to these meso-industry level and macro-national level factors, as well as the micro-organisational level dynamics, will improve our understanding of the relationship between networking and innovation processes. in particular, the paper focuses on how networking activity can be restrictive and lead to the creation of fashions which limit the extent of organisational learning during BPR adoption.

These changes are related to the standard operating procedures, work instructions, and forms. The second stage of changes happens during the implementation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in which the companies have to integrate various departments into one integrated data system. These processes of changes in the companies are called business process redesign or re-engineering (BPR). The changes are conducted by making adjustments to all procedures in the companies so that they can fit into applying ERP modules. Proper adjustments will increase the employment performance for manufacturing companies. The data are collected from 100 questionnaires distributed to the manufacturing companies in East Java, and can further analyze from 77 questionnaires with a 77% response rate. Data processing is performed by using structural equation modeling of PLS and finds that BPR does not provide a direct improvement to the implementation of ERP in the companies. The changes to the standard procedure of the company, or BPR, give an impact of 0.422 to the implementation of ISO 9001. The implementation of ISO 9001 brings an impact of 0.763 on the implementation of ERP. The implementation of ISO 9001 does not affect the company performance, but the implementation of ISO gives a significant impact to the company's performance of 0.664.

Since innovation plays an important role in knowledge work, these processes are different from traditional business processes, for which most business process management (BPM) methods have been developed, and therefore KIBPs should be improved differently. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of BPM in the case of KIBPs by describing some methods that can be applied to manage and improve KIBPs. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a case study of a BPM project in the public sector, where most processes are knowledge-intensive. In conducting the longitudinal case study, established guidelines for interpretive case study research were followed. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected. Findings - The paper presents some findings about the methods that can be applied for BPM in the case of KIBPs. It shows that the main phases of a BPM project can be the same as in a typical project; however, within each project phase different methods have to be applied. Appropriate methods for modelling the existing processes were workshops and interviews. Qualitative methods were suitable for the analysis phase, while it was not necessary to develop detailed to-be models in the business process redesign phase. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the body of knowledge on BPM in the case of KIBPs. Previous findings from the literature claiming that participative, incremental and continuous methods are suitable for improving KIBPs were confirmed. The case study also showed that proper project management, communication, the active role of top management and the involvement of external consultants during BPM projects are very important.";"[Manfreda, Anton; Buh, Brina] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Stemberger, Mojca Indihar] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Informat Management, Ljubljana, Slovenia";Manfreda, A (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.;anton.manfreda@ef.uni-lj.si;"Manfreda, Anton/Q-4120-2019; Indihar Štemberger, Mojca/G-7048-2012";"Manfreda, Anton/0000-0003-0469-5201; Indihar Štemberger, Mojca/0000-0002-2154-5750";36;6;6;1;34;1746-5265;1746-5273;;;2015;10;4;456;477;;10.1108/BJM-10-2014-0170;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BJM-10-2014-0170;22;Management;WOS:000369414600005;View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the evidence of payoff from such investments can be classified as mixed as' best, a problem we partly attribute to the absence of a strong theoretical foundation to assess and analyze reengineering projects. We seek to apply complementarity theory and a business value modeling approach to address some questions involving what, when, and how much to reengineer. Complementarity theory is based on the notion that the value of having more of one factor increases by having more of another complementary factor. Further, related developments in the optimization of ''supermodular'' functions provide a useful way to maximize net benefits by exploiting complementary relationships between variables of interest. Combining this theory with a multi-level business value model showing relationships between key performance measures and their drivers, we argue that organizational payoff is maximized when several factors relating to IT, decision authority, business processes and incentives are changed in a coordinated manner in the right directions by the right magnitude to move toward an ideal design configuration. Our analysis further shows that when a complementary reengineering variable is left unchanged either due to myopic vision or self-interest, the organization will not be able to obtain the full benefits of reengineering due to smaller optimal changes in the other variables. We also show that by increasing the cost of changing the levels of design variables, unfavorable preexisting conditions (e.g., too much heterogeneity in the computing environment) can lead to reengineering changes of smaller magnitude than in a setting with favorable conditions.;UNIV MASSACHUSETTS,COLL MANAGEMENT,BOSTON,MA 02125;Barua, A (corresponding author), UNIV TEXAS,GRAD SCH BUSINESS,DEPT MANAGEMENT SCI & INFORMAT SYST,AUSTIN,TX 78712, USA.;;;;32;99;100;2;17;1047-7047;;;DEC;1996;7;4;409;428;;10.1287/isre.7.4.409;http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/isre.7.4.409;20;"Information Science & Library Science; Management";WOS:A1996WC84400004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Various exploration methods give the prospective users a chance to tackle such complex problems by means of computer. This paper considers two key methodologies within the domain of exploration methods: simulation modelling and value analysis (VA). With worked-out examples, this paper shows, by using the techniques adopted from traditional manufacturing process control, how this problem can be tackled. For retrospective studies focusing to understand and manage internal process variation, statistical process control (SPC) charts together with the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) method is a powerful tool. For prospective studies, focusing to understand and manage the effects due to variability of customer needs, information generated in quality function deployment (QFD) analysis is suggested to be used. All information generated by studies can be used in simulations using Taguchi cross-product redesigns. When the object of VA is a business process instead of a product, the paper also describes how these methods can be applied to business process re-engineering (BPR). The creative problem solving power of VA is especially helpful in BPR. The small improvements can be achieved via the logical analysis and modelling methods but the radical breakthrough improvements require often creative problem solving in addition to modelling. Application of the methods is exposed through a business process example of Neste Advanced Power Systems Finland solar power systems manufacturing, using IDEFO models to be translated for simulation via coloured Petri nets, The conclusion of the paper is that the joined methodology offers a practical advantage for managing simulation studies needed in business process redesign.

With the growing number of tools in the market that claim to support BPM, the variance in actual functionality supported by these tools, and the potentially significant cost of such a purchase. BPM tool selection has become an arduous task. While there is some independent guidance available on how various tools support different aspects of BPM initiatives, organizations still need to determine what their specific needs are and be able to establish how information gathered on tool functionality can be evaluated against these needs. The chapter presents the evaluation criteria that the Queensland Courts derived and used for their needs; the process followed to find and short-list candidate tools to evaluate; and a discussion on findings against the established criteria. While the requirements and evaluation criteria will differ for each organizational context, this chapter provides guidance for business managers on how they may structure and conduct a BPM tool evaluation from a business user perspective. In particular, it provides a score sheet tailored for a business process redesign initiative, which other organizations can use as a starting point and further refine to their specific needs. In addition, it provides suggestions on methods for identifying candidate tools for evaluation (i.e., via market research, on-site visits, gathering recommendations from experiences of others, etc.) from the multitude of BPM solutions currently available. The chapter also highlights the need for BPM tool vendors to invest more in understanding the varying needs of organizations across the BPM spectrum so as to provide accurate information to the right market in a way that potential business users/customers can understand.";"[Davies, Islay] Queensland Govt, Shared Serv Agcy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Reeves, Micheal] Queensland Courts, Dept Justice & Attorney Gen, Brisbane, Qld, Australia";Davies, I (corresponding author), Queensland Govt, Shared Serv Agcy, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;"Islay.davies@ssa.qld.gov.au; Micheal.Reeves@justice.qld.gov.au";Davies, Islay/AAG-6664-2021;Davies, Islay/0000-0003-0573-4700;34;1;1;0;0;;;978-3-642-00415-5;;2010;;;339;360;;10.1007/978-3-642-00416-2_16;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-00416-2_16;22;Computer Science, Information Systems;WOS:000282018500016;View Full Record in Web of Science

In the century of speed, the rigid organizational structures are replaced by flexible, adaptive and temporary organizational structures that support the organization to survive and progress within the troubled transition. Within this context, the organizations will include besides the permanent organizational components more and more temporary components with a short or long lifetime according to the occurring changes. The organizational structures will become modular, and the new informational systems - based on IT - should support this modularity.

There exist many proposals with regard to process improvement patterns (PIPs) as practices that aim at supporting this task. Nevertheless, there is still a gap with respect to validating PIPs in terms of their actual business value for a specific organization. Based on empirical research and experience from consulting projects, this paper proposes a method to tackle this challenge. Our approach towards a-priori validation of process improvement patterns considers real-world constraints such as the role of senior stake-holders and opportunities such as process mining techniques. In the sense of an experience report, our approach as well as results are illustrated on the basis of a real-world business process from human resources management, covering a transactional volume of about 29,000 process instances over the period of one year. Overall, our proposal enables practitioners and researchers to subject PIPs to a sound validation procedure before taking any process implementation decision.;"[Lohrmann, Matthias; Reichert, Manfred] Univ Ulm, Databases & Informat Syst Inst, D-89069 Ulm, Germany";Lohrmann, M (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Databases & Informat Syst Inst, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.;"matthias.lohrmann@uni-ulm.de; manfred.reichert@uni-ulm.de";Reichert, Manfred U/ABB-4469-2020;;27;1;1;0;3;1865-1348;;"978-3-642-38484-4; 978-3-642-38483-7";;2013;147;;230;245;;;;16;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer Science, Theory & Methods";WOS:000345320000016;View Full Record in Web of Science

Some writers argue that an ideal organization structure exists which allows the optimum utilization of IT - a decentralized, flat structure where IT is integrated in the business/administrative units rather than a centralized and separate entity. The emergence of a trend towards this structure is examined by the author through empirical research on the management of IT in 184 private and public sector organizations. Several contextual factors relating to IT and structure are examined. They include organization size; finance and accounting for IT; and management roles and responsibilities. A questionnaire survey was sent to a random sample of public and private sector organizations ranging from local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, building societies and manufacturing firms. Preliminary findings suggest that organizational restructuring is often implemented through ad hoc managerial strategies triggered by financial imperatives, Whilst IT plays a part in the restructuring process, complex environmental and internal influences on organization structure and IT make over-generalization highly problematic.

C;Meijer, BR;Meijer, BR;"From functional organizations to product-oriented organizations; A design methodology";EMS - 2000: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2000 IEEE ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT SOCIETY;English;Proceedings Paper;;;"Functional organization structures have been very common in the manufacturing industries. The departments in a functional organization are based on similar skins, expertise and usually shared use of(similar) resources. The advantage is that specialist knowledge is easily maintained and shared by the people working in the department. Together with the grouping of resources, this results in redundancy in both men and machines. Within a functional department, efficiency and resource utilization can be stretched towards theoretical limits at the expense of high work in progress levels. Manufacturing planning and control for a functional organization however, is a very complex matter and was merely done by rule of thumb (typically one week per process step per department). If a manufacturing process would consist of 50 sequential steps, a delivery time of 1 year would not be uncommon. Monitoring the progress during this year was virtually impossible. Modern planning and control software is often thought of as a solution. Planning software usually fails to work properly if work in progress monitoring cannot be implemented to the level of an individual work order. Moreover, even if work in progress monitoring and tracing is;implemented sufficiently, planning and re-planning of work orders is still a very complex matter. The routing through functional departments introduces many non-value adding material transportation moves. Although functional organizations claim that they are very flexible because they are not obstructed by fixed routings, in practice they lack the means for managing product variety effectively. Since the seventies, matrix organizations have been invented for managing projects across functional departments. More important though, the demand for shorter lead-times and better quality control (customer orientation) has driven many manufacturing organizations towards a product-oriented organization model. Developments in flexible production automation and in production planning and control demanded more integration and this too pointed in the direction of a product-oriented organization model. In this paper, a business process redesign scheme is introduced that tends to favor the design of product oriented organization structures. The key to this scheme is that it designs organization structures that have an intrinsic match between the control instruments present in the organization hierarchy and the natural control needs of the core process. The core process is the process that contains the bare minimal functions absolutely necessary to fulfill the customers needs. The design approach will be illustrated with a case.";Delft Univ Technol, Sect Prod Engn, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands;Meijer, BR (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Sect Prod Engn, Mekelweg 2, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.;;;;4;1;2;1;2;;;0-7803-6443-0;;2000;;;357;362;;10.1109/EMS.2000.872530;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMS.2000.872530;6;Operations Research & Management Science;WOS:000166443900064;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reports the results of case-study research that was conducted in order to explore the operational changes resulting from re-engineering companies along process, rather than functional lines. Increased market responsiveness, improved collaboration between functions and alignment of organisational objectives were some of the perceived benefits of the new process structures; but some disadvantages were also identified. Duplication of functional expertise and increased operational complexity resulted in an escalation of costs, the emergence of horizontal silos, inconsistency in the execution of functional decisions between processes, and general erosion of the efficiency of the operations network. These preliminary findings point to some possible contingencies of organisational design, suggesting that process structures may be conducive to the realisation of differentiation strategies, whilst functional structures may offer benefits to cost leaders. It is further proposed that matrix structures may be appropriate for companies adopting mixed strategies; however, it is envisaged that a more flexible approach to organisational design, based on a network rather than a matrix paradigm, could stimulate new developments in the future quest for strategic and structural alignment.

This research study investigates a novel way to identify potential efficiency gains in business operations by observing how they are carried out in the past and then exploring better ways of executing them by taking into account trade-offs between time, cost and resource utilisation. This paper demonstrates how they can be incorporated in the assessment of alternative process execution scenarios by making use of a cost environment. A genetic algorithm-based approach is proposed to explore and assess alternative process execution scenarios, where the objective function is represented by a comprehensive cost structure that captures different process dimensions. Experiments conducted with different variants of the genetic algorithm evaluate the approach's feasibility. The findings demonstrate that a genetic algorithm-based approach is able to make use of cost reduction as a way to identify improved execution scenarios in terms of reduced case durations and increased resource utilisation. The ultimate aim is to utilise cost-related insights gained from such improved scenarios to put forward recommendations for reducing process-related cost within organisations.;"[Low, W. Z.; Wynn, M.

However, practitioners still lack concrete guidance and adequate objectives for process improvement. Moreover, improvement projects typically tie up considerable amounts of capital and are very risky. Thus, more guidance is needed on how to derive concrete recommendations for process improvement in a goal-oriented manner. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a decision model that determines along which paths the instances of a process should be routed to maximize the value contribution of the process. To do so, the decision model requires a process model and a set of historical process instances as inputs. Findings - The decision model builds on the idea that only the parameters of the process, i.e., the values according to which it is decided on which path an instance traverses the process, can be modified, without altering the structure of the process. The decision model determines the parameter setting that maximizes the value contribution of the process, which is measured in terms of the expected cash flow of the process. When determining the optimal parameter setting, the decision model considers that different instances and paths have different cash flow effects. Practical implications - The authors prototypically implemented the decision model and report on the insights from a demonstration example that is based on the order verification process of an IT distributor. Originality/value - The decision model complements existing approaches to process improvement as it reveals additional improvement potential by focussing on the decision points in a process without altering the structure of the process. The decision model also enables identifying an optimal parameter setting, as a concrete recommendation for process improvement, in line with the principles of value-based BPM.;"[Bolsinger, Manuel; Elsaesser, Anna; Helm, Caroline; Roeglinger, Maximilian] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany";Roglinger, M (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany.;maximilian.roeglinger@fim-rc.de;Röglinger, Maximilian/GQH-4037-2022;;47;9;9;0;9;1463-7154;1758-4116;;;2015;21;2;353;378;;10.1108/BPMJ-02-2014-0011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/BPMJ-02-2014-0011;26;"Business; Management";WOS:000358479200007;View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes an integrated business process reengineering (BPR) framework for improving performance. There are several steps in this framework: creating vision, identifying core processes to be redesigned, analyzing current core processes, designing for innovation, evaluating the new processes, selecting the best, and transforming and implementing the resulting design. A core process analysis matrix is proposed for identifying the critical processes. System simulation is useful in measuring the performance and predicting the effect of change on the system. To reduce the risk of BPR, an object-oriented simulation framework is developed for evaluating and analyzing the reengineering proposals. This paper uses a case study to show the value of the method.

However, the failure rates were as high as 70%. Various reasons for this have been given in past research. One major reason was that the efforts had not been connected to the corporate goals, In addition, the steps in implementing BPR in past discussions were, however, incomplete and the papers merely reported a part of the process. This study proposes an integrative approach based on a strategic perspective, Basically, this framework involves three steps that: (1) identify corporate strategies based on analysis of a strategic thrust/strategic target matrix; (2) select strategic paths for BPR based on analysis of a functional coupling framework with the IT application; (3) implement BPR based on analysis of project characteristics to decide on a suitable version of the composite methodology. Furthermore, this framework is illustrated by using an empirical study to demonstrate its application in some business units. (C), 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the face of high incidence of IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. The paper discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework, referred to as POE-Delta, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems. We generalize an existing theory of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems: from a theoretical perspective POE-Delta is a subset of its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems. Its initial case study evaluation shows that POE-Delta allows the systematic analysis of change problems, leading to clearer understanding and better informed decision making.

To this end, it is required to optimize medical scheduling for clinicians. A typical approach for deriving the optimized schedules is to perform experiments using discrete event simulation. The existing work has developed how to build a simulation model based on process mining techniques. However, applying this method for outpatient processes straightforwardly, in particular medical scheduling, is challenging: 1) the collected data from electronic health record system requires a series of processes to acquire simulation parameters from the raw data; and 2) even if the derived simulation model fully reflects the reality, there is no systematic approach to deriving effective improvements for simulation analysis, i.e., experimental scenarios. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel decision support framework for a clinician's schedule using simulation analysis. In the proposed framework, a data-driven simulation model is constructed based on process mining analysis, which includes process discovery, patient arrival rate analysis, and service time analysis. Also, a series of steps to derive the optimal improvement method from the simulation analysis is included in the framework.

Although there are clear benefits in mining the goals of existing processes, goal-oriented approaches that consider logs during model construction are still rare. Process mining techniques, when generalizing large instance-level data into process models, can be considered as a data-driven complement to use case/scenario elicitation. Requirements engineers can exploit process mining techniques to find new system or process requirements in order to align current practices and desired ones. This paper provides a systemic literature review, based on 24 papers rigorously selected from four popular search engines in 2018, to assess the state of goal-oriented process mining. Through two research questions, the review highlights that the use of process mining in association with goals does not yet have a coherent line of research, whereas intention mining (where goal models are mined) shows a meaningful trace of research. Research about performance indicators measuring goals associated with process mining is also sparse. Although the number of publications in process mining and goal modeling is trending up, goal mining and goal-oriented process mining remain modest research areas. Yet, synergetic effects achievable by combining goals and process mining can potentially augment the precision, rationality and interpretability of mined models and eventually improve opportunities to satisfy system stakeholders.;"[Ghasemi, Mahdi; Amyot, Daniel] Univ Ottawa, Sch EECS, 800 King Edward, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada";Amyot, D (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch EECS, 800 King Edward, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.;"mghas020@uottawa.ca; damyot@uottawa.ca";Amyot, Daniel/AAI-6948-2020;Amyot, Daniel/0000-0003-2414-1791;115;15;16;17;53;0947-3602;1432-010X;;MAR;2020;25;1;67;93;;10.1007/s00766-018-00308-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-00308-3;27;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering";WOS:000512947400004;View Full Record in Web of Science

Although one can speculate on the reasons for the popularity of this phenomenon, it is important that we carefully examine its underlying antecedents for initiation, implementation, and ultimately success, if we are to add value to practitioners of this concept. This study empirically examines the importance of facets of the organizational structure, IT knowledge resources and infrastructure, and the IS function in the initiation of BPR. Data from 313 corporations were gathered using a carefully validated survey, and initiators were compared with noninitiators. The results strongly suggest that client-server architectures, the strategic integration of IS, and cross departmental interaction are among the more important factors facilitating initiation and can be important inputs in a BPR decision-making process.

Entropic-related complexity is defined as the amount of information needed to describe the state of a system; a measure which captures the extent of uncertainty and variety within the system. To evaluate BPR's impact, complexity is calculated before and after the intervention for three elements of the supply chain: incoming supply process, production process and outgoing customer delivery process. The complexity measures are derived from the time-related performance of these three system elements. The results show that the robustness of supply chains, i.e. their ability to perform well despite disturbances, can be assessed using entropic-related complexity retrospectively (after a change has occurred), but it could also be used prospectively (if anticipated outcomes could be estimated) before embarking on BPR initiatives.";"[Huatuco, Luisa Huaccho; Burgess, Thomas F.; Shaw, Nicky E.] Univ Leeds, LUBS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England";Huatuco, LH (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, LUBS, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.;lh2@lubs.leeds.ac.uk;"Burgess, Thomas F/M-7144-2013; Huatuco, Luisa/J-1246-2019";"Burgess, Thomas F/0000-0003-2682-5812; Huatuco, Luisa/0000-0003-0303-0857";35;10;11;1;17;0953-7287;;;;2010;21;8;724;735;PII 924419395;10.1080/09537281003596185;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537281003596185;12;"Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing; Operations Research & Management Science";WOS:000284538700002;View Full Record in Web of Science

It seeks to identify process redesign principles and the combinations of these principles that are used successfully in industry. We use Q-methodology to explore the viewpoints of a range of highly experienced process experts about the success of 16 improvement practices. Q-methodology enables the examination of the similarities and differences in the success of the improvement principles used by organisations in order to inform archetypes of process improvement. Overall, our findings suggest that process improvement is determined through the application of two foundational principles combined with one of four archetypes. 'Remove non-value-adding tasks' and 're-sequence tasks' are described as foundational principles of process improvement, whilst outsourcing needs to be approached with caution. Furthermore, we articulate four distinctive archetypes comprising unique configurations of improvement principles that can be used to redesign operational processes. Based on this evidence we propose a typology of process improvement. This work suggests that rather than adopting generic improvement frameworks, managers should consult the typology to determine the archetype in closest proximity to their specific requirements.

The best practices are implemented for achieving lower-level business unit objectives and higher-level strategic goals of an organization. With a multiattribute decision making algorithm under the balanced scorecard (BSC) framework, a new evaluation model is developed to effectively measure the relationship between lower-level objectives and higher-level goals, and to give each best practice a relative priority value. A new adjustment method is also developed to address potential biases in the self-assessment process at the business unit level. The evaluation model enables the prioritization and implementation planning of best practices in terms of their importance and achievability from the viewpoints of the organization, four BSC strategic perspectives, individual business units, and the overall implementation planning zone. An empirical study is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the integrated evaluation and planning approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A broad spectrum of methods has been proposed since the 1990s, which ranges into several dozen. It is unclear whether this large number trivially stems from copying and relabeling or whether there are substantial differences in these methods that can be tied to their applicability in different contexts or to the pursuit of different goals. Accordingly, we ask: Which activities do process improvement methods have in common, how do they differ, and why? In this paper, we approach these research questions using a multi-method design integrating techniques from systematic literature review, process mining, and statistical analysis. Our contributions are as follows. First, we provide a framework with 264 activities clustered in six stages that could be used for incrementally and radically improving processes. Second, we find that methods map to different configurations of the three dimensions described by the redesign orbit. Third, we uncover similarities and differences of the different methods contingent to the factors industry, objectives and whether a method is proposed or applied. Fourth, we observe three distinct clusters of method activities, which show that different strategies play a role when choosing a method for improvement. Our findings have important implications for the application of improvement methods in various improvement scenarios. (C) 2021 The Authors.

The methodology (named HY-CHANGE) is conceived as a logical and technical support to the decision maker. It results in a number of recursive phases, where the rational and synchronous use of several tools and techniques, borrowed from the two methodologies mentioned above, is structured into a unique approach. HY-CHANGE thus offers a structured guide for performance improvement processes more suited to the enterprise reality and its dynamical evolution. The value of the methodology is to provide a structured frame to use several methodologies and tools (here referred to as 'decisional tool-kit') with the scope of effectively managing change processes at any level within the enterprise.

We also extract the reported application studies and classify these by exploration domains or industry segments that are taking advantage of this technique. The applied research method was systematic mapping, which began with 3713 articles. After applying the exclusion criteria, 1278 articles were selected for review. In this article, an overview regarding process mining is presented, the main research topics are identified, followed by identification of the most applied process mining algorithms, and finally application domains among different business segments are reported on. It is possible to observe that the most active research topics are associated with the process discovery algorithms, followed by conformance checking, and architecture and tools improvements.
